description: 'Master the art of therapeutic conversation through AI-powered practice sessions — browse scenarios, engage with realistic clients, and accelerate your skill development.'
---

The Empathy Gym™ is a high-fidelity, risk-free training environment where you
practice therapeutic conversations with AI-powered client simulations. Each
session provides real-time feedback, detailed analytics, and actionable insights
to help you build clinical confidence.

<Note>
  The Empathy Gym™ uses advanced emotional intelligence models trained on over
  10,960 psychology concepts, therapeutic conversation examples, and psychology
  literature. The AI clients respond with realistic emotional patterns,
  resistance, and vulnerability — not scripted dialogue trees.
</Note>

## How The Empathy Gym™ Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Scenario">
    Browse the scenario library and select a training scenario based on your
    focus areas, difficulty preference, and available time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Practice with an AI Client">
    Engage in a realistic therapeutic conversation. The AI client adapts to your
    responses — just like a real client would.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Real-Time Feedback">
    Non-intrusive feedback appears alongside the conversation, highlighting
    empathic responses, potential biases, and missed opportunities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Reflect">
    After the session, review your annotated transcript, scores, and
    personalized improvement suggestions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Browsing the Scenario Library

The scenario library is your starting point for every training session.
Navigate to **Empathy Gym™ → Scenario Library** to explore available scenarios.

### Filtering Scenarios

Use the filter panel to narrow your search:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Topic">
    Filter by clinical topic to match your training goals:

    - **Anxiety & Depression** — Generalized anxiety, panic disorders, major
      depressive episodes
    - **Trauma & PTSD** — Childhood trauma, sexual assault, combat-related PTSD,
      complex trauma
    - **Substance Use** — Alcohol dependency, opioid use, harm reduction
      conversations

      parent

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Difficulty">
    Scenarios are organized into four progressive difficulty levels:

    | Level | Label | What to Expect |
    |:---|:---|:---|
    | 🌱 | Foundation | Straightforward presentations, cooperative clients, clear emotional expressions |
    | 🌿 | Standard | Mixed emotions, mild resistance, some ambiguity in presenting concerns |
    | 🌳 | Advanced | Complex comorbidities, significant resistance, cultural considerations, indirect communication |
    | 🏔️ | Expert | Crisis situations, hostile/withdrawn clients, intersecting identities, ethical dilemmas |

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Duration">
    Choose based on your available time:

    - **Quick Practice** (10–15 minutes) — Focused micro-sessions targeting one skill
    - **Standard Session** (20–30 minutes) — Full therapeutic encounter
    - **Extended Session** (40–60 minutes) — In-depth practice with complex scenarios
    - **Multi-Session Arc** (series of 3–5 sessions) — Follow a client across
      multiple appointments

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Skill Focus">
    Target specific competencies:

    - Active Listening
    - Empathic Response (EARS Framework)
    - Crisis Intervention
    - Bias Awareness
    - Cultural Competency
    - Motivational Interviewing
    - Cognitive Behavioral Techniques
    - Boundary Setting

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Understanding Scenario Cards

Each scenario card in the library displays:

- **Title** — A brief descriptor (e.g., "First Session: College Student with
  Anxiety")
- **Difficulty Badge** — Color-coded level indicator
- **Topic Tags** — Clinical areas covered
- **Skill Tags** — Competencies practiced
- **Duration Estimate** — Expected session length
- **Completion Count** — How many times you've practiced this scenario
- **Community Rating** — Average helpfulness rating from other therapists

<Tip>
  Look for the ⭐ **Staff Pick** badge — these scenarios are curated by clinical
  psychologists for exceptional training value at each difficulty level.
</Tip>

## Selecting Difficulty Levels

Choosing the right difficulty level is key to effective training. Push yourself
enough to grow, but not so much that you feel overwhelmed.

### Progressive Difficulty Approach

We recommend the **70/20/10 rule** for your weekly training:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="70% Comfort Zone+" icon="seedling">
    Scenarios slightly above your current skill level. This is where consistent
    improvement happens.
  </Card>
  <Card title="20% Stretch Zone" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    Challenging scenarios that push your boundaries. Expect to struggle — that's
    the point.
  </Card>
  <Card title="10% Mastery Review" icon="check-double">
    Revisit easier scenarios to reinforce skills and build confidence. Notice
    how far you've come.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Adaptive Difficulty

The platform automatically adjusts scenario difficulty based on your performance:

- **Auto-Adjust ON (default)** — Difficulty increases when you consistently
  score above 0.80 on empathy metrics, and decreases if you drop below 0.50
- **Auto-Adjust OFF** — You manually select difficulty for every session
- **Locked Difficulty** — Your supervisor sets a specific level for assigned scenarios

You can toggle auto-adjust in **Settings → Training Preferences → Difficulty
Mode**.

## Engaging with AI Clients

### The Conversation Interface

When you start a session, you'll enter the conversation view:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Chat Panel" icon="comments">
    The main area where conversation happens. Messages appear in distinct bubbles:

    - **Client messages** appear on the left with the client's avatar
    - **Your responses** appear on the right
    - **System notes** (scenario updates, time markers) appear centered in a muted style

    The AI client types with realistic pacing — you'll see a typing indicator
    before their response, simulating natural conversation rhythm.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response Input" icon="keyboard">
    Type your therapeutic response in the input area at the bottom. Tips:

    - Press **Enter** to send, or **Shift+Enter** for a new line
    - There's no character limit, but shorter, more focused responses tend to
      score higher
    - Take your time — there's no penalty for thoughtful pauses
    - Use the **Suggested Starters** button if you're unsure how to begin
      (available at Foundation level)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Feedback Sidebar" icon="chart-simple">
    The collapsible sidebar on the right shows real-time analysis:

    - **Empathy Indicator** — Live gauge showing your current empathy alignment (0–1)
    - **Technique Tags** — Detected therapeutic techniques in your last response
    - **Bias Alerts** — Flagged if a potential bias is detected (expandable for details)
    - **Suggestion Cards** — Brief tips that appear based on the conversation context

    You can collapse the sidebar by clicking the arrow icon if you prefer an immersive experience. All feedback is preserved in the session review.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session Controls" icon="sliders">
    Access controls via the top bar:

    - **Pause** — Temporarily halt the session (the AI client waits)
    - **Hint** — Get a contextual suggestion without seeing the "answer" (costs no points)
    - **Restart** — Begin the scenario from the top (previous attempt is still saved)
    - **End Session** — Complete the session and move to review
    - **Emergency Exit** — Immediately leave if content is triggering (no data recorded)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### AI Client Behaviors

The AI clients in The Empathy Gym™ are designed to behave realistically. You may encounter:

- **Emotional shifts** — Clients may become more open as trust builds, or
  withdraw if they feel judged
- **Resistance** — Some clients test boundaries, deflect questions, or express
  skepticism about therapy
- **Silence** — Clients may pause, indicating processing or discomfort (resist
  the urge to fill every silence)
- **Cultural context** — Clients bring diverse cultural backgrounds that
  influence how they express and process emotions
- **Crisis escalation** — In advanced scenarios, a client's distress may
  intensify based on your responses

<Warning>
  **Crisis scenarios are clearly labeled** before you enter them. If you
  encounter unexpected crisis content during a session, use the **Emergency
  Exit** button. The platform will never penalize you for prioritizing your own
  wellbeing.
</Warning>

### Tips for Authentic Practice

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Respond Naturally" icon="feather">
    Type as you would actually speak in a session. Don't try to "game" the
    scoring system — authenticity produces better learning outcomes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Take Your Time" icon="hourglass-half">
    Real therapy isn't speed-based. Pausing to think before responding is a
    strength, not a weakness. The AI client will wait.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use the EARS Framework" icon="ear-listen">
    Structure your responses: Empathize → Acknowledge → Reflect → Support. See
    the [Response Style Guide](/guides/therapists/response-style) for details.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Embrace Mistakes" icon="heart-crack">
    The whole point is to make mistakes here instead of with real clients. A low
    score on a practice session is valuable data, not a failure.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Receiving Real-Time Feedback

Feedback in The Empathy Gym™ is designed to be **informative without being
intrusive**. It respects your flow while providing actionable insights.

### Feedback Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Empathy Signals">
    Real-time empathy analysis of each response you send:

    - **Strong empathy detected** (💚) — Your response effectively named emotions, validated experience, or demonstrated presence
    - **Partial empathy** (💛) — Your response addressed content but may have missed the emotional subtext
    - **Empathy gap** (🟠) — An opportunity to deepen your empathic connection was missed
    - **Disconnection risk** (🔴) — The response may have felt dismissive, minimizing, or prescriptive to the client

    Each signal includes a one-sentence explanation you can expand for more detail.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Technique Detection">
    The platform identifies therapeutic techniques in your responses:

    - Reflective listening
    - Open-ended questioning
    - Summarizing
    - Normalizing
    - Reframing
    - Motivational interviewing techniques
    - Boundary setting
    - Psychoeducation

    Detected techniques appear as small tags below your message bubble. This helps you become more intentional about which techniques you employ.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bias Alerts">
    When a potential bias is detected, a discreet alert appears in the sidebar:

    - **Type** — Cultural, gender, racial, socioeconomic, age-related, or ability-related
    - **Confidence** — How confident the system is in the detection (Low / Medium / High)
    - **Explanation** — What pattern triggered the alert
    - **Alternative** — A suggested rephrasing that avoids the bias

    <Info>
      Bias alerts are learning tools, not accusations. Everyone has unconscious
      biases — the goal is awareness, not perfection. Low-confidence alerts may
      be false positives; review them with curiosity rather than judgment.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Crisis Detection">
    If the AI client expresses crisis-level distress, the platform activates additional guidance:

    - **Crisis Signal Detected** banner appears at the top of the feedback
      sidebar
    - **Recommended approach** — Connection-first language suggestions
    - **Safety planning prompts** — Collaborative safety planning templates
    - **What NOT to do** — Common missteps in crisis situations

    These prompts help you practice crisis response in a safe environment. See
    [Understanding Feedback](/guides/therapists/understanding-feedback) for how
    crisis handling affects your scores.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adjusting Feedback Verbosity

Customize how much real-time feedback you receive in **Settings → Training Preferences → Feedback Level**:

| Level           | Description                                             | Best For                                                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Minimal**     | Only crisis alerts and major empathy gaps               | Experienced practitioners who want immersive sessions   |
| **Standard**    | Key empathy signals and bias alerts                     | Most users — balanced between guidance and flow         |
| **Detailed**    | All signals, technique tags, and suggestions            | Beginners or anyone focused on intensive skill-building |
| **Mentor Mode** | Everything above plus guided prompts before you respond | First-time users or complex scenarios                   |

## Reviewing Sessions

After ending a session, you're taken to the **Session Review** page — one of the
most valuable parts of The Empathy Gym™.

    - "Was there a point where you felt stuck? What was happening?"
    - "If you could redo one response, which would it be and why?"
    - "What did you learn about yourself as a therapist in this session?"

    Your reflections are saved privately and can be shared with your supervisor if you choose.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Comparing Sessions

Track your growth by comparing sessions over time:

- **Side-by-Side View** — Compare two sessions of the same scenario to see improvement
- **Score Trends** — Graph your empathy, connection, and technique scores over weeks and months
- **Bias Trend** — Track whether bias alerts are decreasing over time
- **Supervisor Notes** — View feedback your supervisor has added to reviewed sessions

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Training

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Set a Consistent Schedule" icon="calendar">
    Regular practice outperforms sporadic marathons. Even 2–3 short sessions per
    week create meaningful growth over time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Every Session" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Don't skip the review phase. Spending 5–10 minutes on the annotated
    transcript and reflection prompts doubles the learning value of each
    session.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Replay Difficult Scenarios" icon="rotate-right">
    Struggling with a scenario? Replay it. You'll often find that awareness of
    the difficulty itself improves your next attempt.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Multi-Session Arcs" icon="timeline">
    Follow a single AI client across multiple sessions to practice building
    rapport over time — a skill you can't develop in one-off exercises.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Share with Your Supervisor" icon="share-nodes">
    Invite your supervisor to review key sessions. External feedback combined
    with platform analytics creates the richest learning experience.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track One Skill at a Time" icon="bullseye">
    While the platform measures many competencies, focusing your attention on
    one skill per week leads to faster, deeper improvement.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Power User Tip**: After completing a scenario, try the same scenario again
  but deliberately use a different therapeutic approach. Compare the two
  sessions side-by-side to see how different techniques affect client response
  and your scores.
</Tip>

## Scenario Types Deep Dive

### Standard Scenarios

Structured encounters with a defined client persona, presenting concern, and
session goals. These form the backbone of your training.

### Edge Case Scenarios

Rare but critical situations that may not arise during regular clinical training:

- Client discloses abuse during an unrelated session
- Cross-cultural misunderstanding escalates to conflict
- Client becomes hostile toward the therapist
- Sudden psychotic episode during conversation
- Ethical dilemma with no clear right answer

### Multi-Session Arcs

Follow a client across 3–5 connected sessions:

- Session 1: Initial intake and rapport building
- Session 2: Deeper exploration and goal setting
- Session 3: Active intervention and skill practice
- Session 4: Managing setbacks and resistance
- Session 5: Progress review and future planning

The AI client remembers previous sessions and their emotional state evolves
based on your cumulative interactions.

### Custom Scenarios

If your institution has created custom scenarios, they appear in a dedicated **Institution** tab in the scenario library. These are designed to match your specific training program objectives.
