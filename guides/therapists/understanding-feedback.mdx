title: 'Understanding Your Feedback'
description: 'A complete guide to reading your empathy scores, bias detection alerts, competency metrics, and progress tracking in Pixelated Empathy.'
---

Every training session in The Empathy Gym™ generates rich performance data
designed to help you grow as a clinician. This guide explains what each metric
means, how scores are calculated, and what to focus on improving.

<Note>
  Scores are **learning tools, not judgments**. A score of 0.60 doesn't mean
  you're a "C-grade" therapist — it means the platform identified specific,
  actionable areas where you can deepen your empathic response. Even experienced
  clinicians with decades of practice discover growth opportunities through
  structured feedback.
</Note>

## Empathy Scores

Your empathy score is the primary metric in The Empathy Gym™. It measures how
effectively your responses convey genuine understanding, validation, and
presence.

### The 0–1 Scale

All emotion and empathy scores in Pixelated Empathy are normalized to a
**0.0 to 1.0 range**:

| Score Range    | Level        | Interpretation                                                                                                   |
| :------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0.90–1.00**  | Exceptional  | Consistently deep empathic connection. Responses demonstrate masterful emotional attunement.                     |
| **0.80–0.89**  | Strong       | Reliably empathic responses with effective emotion naming, validation, and presence.                             |
| **0.70–0.79**  | Developing   | Good foundational empathy with room to deepen reflection and emotional specificity.                              |
| **0.60–0.69**  | Emerging     | Addresses content well but frequently misses emotional subtext or relies on generic responses.                   |
| **0.50–0.59**  | Foundational | Beginning to demonstrate empathic elements. Responses tend toward advice-giving or surface-level acknowledgment. |
| **Below 0.50** | Growth Area  | Significant opportunity to develop empathic response patterns. Responses may feel disconnected or prescriptive.  |

<Info>
  The platform's quality gate targets are **Empathy Score > 0.80** and
  **Connection Score > 0.70**. These aren't pass/fail thresholds — they're
  aspirational targets that indicate strong clinical communication.

### How Empathy Scores Are Calculated

Your empathy score is computed from multiple signals analyzed in each response
you send:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Emotion Recognition (25% weight)" icon="brain">
    Does your response demonstrate that you identified the client's emotional state?

    - **High score**: "It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and maybe a little scared about what comes next."
    - **Medium score**: "That sounds really hard."
    - **Low score**: "Have you tried making a list of your priorities?"

    The model evaluates whether you named specific emotions rather than using vague or generic language.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validation Quality (25% weight)" icon="heart">
    Does your response validate the client's experience without minimizing or dismissing?

    - **High score**: "What you're feeling makes complete sense given everything you've been carrying."
    - **Medium score**: "That's understandable."
    - **Low score**: "Everyone goes through tough times — you'll get through this."

    The model distinguishes between genuine validation and toxic positivity, platitudes, or comparative minimization.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reflective Accuracy (25% weight)" icon="mirror">
    Does your response accurately mirror the client's expressed themes and concerns?

    - **High score**: "You mentioned feeling trapped between your family's expectations and what you actually want for your career — like there's no path that doesn't disappoint someone."
    - **Medium score**: "So you're having trouble with your family."
    - **Low score**: "Family can be complicated. What else is going on?"

    The model measures how precisely you reflect the client's specific words, themes, and underlying meaning.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Therapeutic Presence (25% weight)" icon="hand-holding-heart">
    Does your response convey that you are fully present and engaged?

    - **High score**: "I'm right here with you. Take all the time you need."
    - **Medium score**: "I hear you."
    - **Low score**: "Okay, let's move on to discuss some coping strategies."

    The model evaluates language that communicates presence, patience, non-judgment, and willingness to sit with discomfort.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Per-Response vs. Session Scores

- **Per-response score**: Each message you send receives an individual empathy
  score (visible in the annotated transcript during review)
- **Session score**: The aggregated score across all your responses, weighted by
  conversation context (responses during emotionally intense moments carry
  slightly more weight)

## Bias Detection Alerts

The bias detection system monitors your responses for unconscious patterns that
could impact therapeutic effectiveness.

### Types of Bias Detected

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cultural Bias">
    Assumptions based on cultural background:

    - Assuming communication norms (e.g., eye contact expectations)
    - Projecting Western therapeutic frameworks onto non-Western experiences
    - Overlooking culturally specific expressions of distress
    - Making assumptions about family dynamics based on cultural stereotypes

    **Example alert**: *"Your response assumes the client's reluctance to express
    emotion reflects avoidance. In some cultural contexts, emotional restraint is
    a valued form of strength."*

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Gender Bias">
    Gendered assumptions in therapeutic response:

    - Different emotional expectations based on gender
    - Assuming relationship dynamics or roles
    - Using gendered language unnecessarily
    - Minimizing or amplifying concerns based on gender

    **Example alert**: *"Your response normalizes emotional suppression ('it's
    okay to not cry'). Consider whether this guidance would differ if the client
    presented differently."*

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Racial Bias">
    Race-related assumptions in communication:

    - Different levels of credibility given to expressed experiences
    - Assumptions about socioeconomic circumstances
    - Failure to acknowledge race-related stressors
    - Colorblind approaches that erase lived experience

    **Example alert**: *"The client raised experiences of racial discrimination.
    Your response redirected to general stress management without acknowledging
    the racial component."*

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Socioeconomic Bias">
    Assumptions related to economic status:

    - Recommending resources that assume financial access
    - Minimizing financial stress as a clinical concern
    - Assumptions about education, housing, or lifestyle
    - Language that assumes specific life circumstances

    **Example alert**: *"Your suggestion to 'take a vacation' may not account for the client's expressed financial constraints."*

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Age & Ability Bias">
    Assumptions based on age or ability:

    - Patronizing language toward older or younger clients
    - Assuming cognitive or physical capabilities
    - Overlooking generational context for presenting concerns
    - Disability-related assumptions

    **Example alert**: *"Your response used simplified language that wasn't
    matched to the client's demonstrated communication level."*

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Alert Confidence Levels

Each bias alert includes a confidence level:

- **High Confidence** — Clear pattern detected; strong recommendation to review
  and adjust
- **Medium Confidence** — Potential bias pattern; worth reflecting on but may
  be contextually appropriate
- **Low Confidence** — Possible bias signal; consider as a reflection prompt
  rather than a definitive flag

<Tip>
  Don't aim for zero bias alerts. The goal is **awareness and trend reduction**.
  Even the most culturally competent therapists occasionally use language that
  could be perceived differently across contexts. What matters is your
  trajectory over time.
</Tip>

### Bias Score Impact

Bias alerts don't directly reduce your empathy score. Instead, they contribute
to a separate **Bias Awareness Score** (0–1) that tracks:

- Frequency of alerts per session (fewer is better)
- Diversity of alert types (alerts clustered in one category suggest a specific
  blind spot)
- Response to alerts over time (improvement trend is most important)

## Competency Scores

Beyond empathy and bias, the platform tracks your proficiency across multiple
therapeutic competencies.

</CardGroup>

### Competency Radar Chart

Your **Progress** dashboard displays a radar chart showing all competency scores
simultaneously. This visualization makes it easy to identify:

- **Strengths** — Competencies where you consistently score above 0.80
- **Growth areas** — Competencies below 0.60 that need focused attention
- **Balance** — Whether your skills are evenly developed or heavily skewed

### How Competency Scores Are Calculated

Each competency is scored based on relevant behavioral indicators detected
across your sessions:

## Progress Tracking

### Trend Visualization

The **Progress → Trends** page shows your scores over time across multiple dimensions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weekly View" icon="calendar-week">
    Your average scores for each week, plotted as a line graph. This view is
    best for:

    - Spotting short-term improvements after focused practice
    - Identifying weeks where scores dipped (and correlating with what you
      practiced)
    - Validating that your current training approach is working

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monthly View" icon="calendar">
    Aggregated monthly performance with trend arrows. This view is best for:

    - Seeing the big picture of your development trajectory
    - Setting and evaluating monthly learning goals
    - Preparing for supervisor check-ins or performance reviews

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skill Breakdown" icon="chart-pie">
    Individual trend lines for each competency area. This view is best for:

    - Identifying which skills are improving fastest
    - Discovering plateau patterns that might need a different training approach
    - Comparing improvement rates across different skill areas

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session-by-Session" icon="list-timeline">
    Every individual session score plotted chronologically. This view is best for:

    - Analyzing the impact of specific scenario types on your scores
    - Identifying your best and worst sessions for targeted review
    - Understanding how difficulty level affects your performance

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Milestone Tracking

The platform automatically recognizes and celebrates milestones:

- 🏅 **First Session Complete** — You showed up and started
- 📈 **First Score Improvement** — Your empathy score improved from one session
  to the next
- 🎯 **Consistency Streak** — 5 sessions in a row above your target score
- 💪 **Skill Unlocked** — A competency score crossed above 0.80 for the first time
- 🌟 **Bias Breakthrough** — 5 consecutive sessions with zero bias alerts in a
  previously flagged category
- 🏆 **Mastery Level** — All competency scores above 0.80 in a single session

## Comparative Benchmarking

### How Benchmarks Work

Your scores are compared anonymously against therapists at the same experience
level and focus area:

- **Percentile ranking** — Where you fall relative to peers (e.g., "75th
  percentile in Active Listening among 2–5 year practitioners")
- **Peer average** — The mean score for your cohort in each competency
- **Top quartile target** — The score threshold for the top 25% of your cohort

<Warning>
  Benchmarks are for **context, not competition**. Therapeutic skill development
  is deeply personal. Use peer comparisons to calibrate your expectations, not
  to judge your worth as a clinician.
</Warning>

### Benchmark Visibility Settings

You control how benchmarks appear in your dashboard:

- **Full Benchmarks** — See percentile, peer average, and top quartile for all
  metrics
- **Averages Only** — See peer averages without percentile rankings
- **Hidden** — Disable benchmarks entirely and focus only on your personal
  progress
- **Supervisor View** — Your supervisor can see benchmarks in their dashboard
  (this is separate from your personal settings)

Adjust in **Settings → Training Preferences → Benchmark Display**.

## What to Focus on Improving

### Reading Your Feedback Strategically

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Lowest Competency">
    Look at your competency radar chart. Your lowest-scoring area is where
    focused practice will have the most impact on your overall clinical
    effectiveness.
  </Step>

<Step title="Review Flagged Moments">
  In your recent session transcripts, read through the amber-highlighted
  exchanges. These are specific moments where a different response could have
  deepened the therapeutic connection.
</Step>

<Step title="Study the Alternatives">
  Click "See alternative" on flagged responses. Notice the patterns —
  alternatives typically use more specific emotion language, shorter sentences,
  and more collaborative framing.
</Step>

<Step title="Practice with Targeted Scenarios">
  Choose scenarios that specifically exercise your growth area. If your crisis
  intervention score is lowest, select crisis-tagged scenarios. If cultural
  competency needs work, choose scenarios with diverse client personas.
</Step>

  <Step title="Track Your Trend">
    After 3–5 focused sessions, check your trend graph. You should see
    measurable improvement in your target area. If not, consider adjusting your
    approach or discussing strategies with your supervisor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Growth Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'I score well on empathy but low on technique diversity'" icon="shuffle">
    You're naturally empathic but tend to rely on the same techniques. **Try**:
    Deliberately use one new technique per session (summarizing, reframing, or
    motivational interviewing). The technique detection tags will help you
    track this.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="'My bias alerts cluster in one category'" icon="filter">
  A cluster pattern suggests a specific blind spot rather than general bias.
  **Try**: Read the detailed explanations on each alert. Reflect on personal
  experiences or training gaps that might contribute. Consider requesting a
  cultural competency-focused scenario set.
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="'My scores are inconsistent — high one session, low the next'"
  icon="chart-line"
>
  Inconsistency often correlates with scenario difficulty or topic comfort.
  **Try**: Note which topics produce your lowest scores. These may represent
  personal triggers or knowledge gaps that benefit from targeted study or
  supervision.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'I plateau around 0.75 and can't break through'" icon="minus">
  Plateaus are normal and usually indicate that automatic habits need conscious
  refinement. **Try**: Switch to Detailed or Mentor Mode feedback for a few
  sessions. The additional guidance can help you identify the specific
  micro-behaviors holding you back.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion
    title="'My crisis intervention scores are significantly lower than other areas'"
    icon="triangle-exclamation"
  >
    Crisis scenarios are inherently harder — the emotional stakes trigger
    different response patterns. **Try**: Review the [EARS Framework crisis
    approach](/guides/therapists/response-style#crisis-approach) and practice
    connection-first language in lower-stakes scenarios before attempting
    expert-level crisis simulations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Score Limitations

<Info>
  No AI scoring system perfectly captures the nuance of human therapeutic
  connection. Keep these limitations in mind:

- **Cultural context**: The model may not fully account for all cultural
  communication norms
- **Therapeutic modality**: Scores are optimized for person-centered and
  empathy-focused approaches; other valid modalities (CBT, DBT, psychodynamic)
  may score differently
- **Individual client needs**: What's "empathic" varies by client — a score
  reflects general best practices, not what a specific real client might need
- **False positives**: Bias alerts at low confidence may flag contextually
  appropriate responses
- **Novelty**: Highly creative or unconventional therapeutic responses may not
  be recognized by the model

  Always combine platform feedback with your clinical judgment, supervisor
  input, and self-reflection.
