    | Intermediate | 2–5 years | Standard |

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Selecting Training Focus Areas

Training focus areas define what skills you want to develop. You can select up
to five initial focus areas:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active Listening" icon="ear-listen">
    Reflective listening, paraphrasing, summarizing, and demonstrating presence
    during sessions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Empathic Response" icon="heart">
    Naming emotions, validating experiences, and communicating genuine
    understanding using the EARS framework.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Crisis Intervention" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Recognizing crisis signals, collaborative safety planning, and maintaining
    connection under pressure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bias Awareness" icon="scale-balanced">
    Identifying unconscious biases related to culture, gender, race, and
    socioeconomic status in your responses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cultural Competency" icon="earth-americas">

    and communication styles.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Motivational Interviewing" icon="comments">
    Rolling with resistance, developing discrepancy, and supporting
    self-efficacy in client-directed change.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Not sure what to pick? Start with **Active Listening** and **Empathic
  Response** — these are foundational skills that support everything else. You
  can always add more focus areas later from your dashboard settings.
</Tip>

## Your First Training Session

Now for the exciting part — let's walk through your first practice session in
The Empathy Gym™.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Scenario Library">
    Navigate to **Empathy Gym™ → Scenario Library**. You'll see a curated list of
    scenarios filtered by your experience level and focus areas.

    For your first session, we recommend starting with a **Foundation**
    difficulty scenario. Look for ones tagged with a 🌱 icon — these are
    specifically designed for first-time users.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Scenario Brief">
    Click on a scenario to see its brief. Each brief includes:

    - **Client Profile** — Demographics, presenting concern, and relevant background
    - **Session Goals** — What therapeutic objectives to work toward
    - **Key Challenges** — What makes this scenario a learning opportunity
    - **Estimated Duration** — Typically 15–30 minutes for foundation scenarios

    <Warning>
      Some scenarios involve sensitive topics (suicidal ideation, trauma, abuse).
      These are clearly labeled with content warnings. You are never required to
      engage with any scenario — choose what feels right for your current
      development stage.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Begin the Conversation">
    Click **Start Session** to enter the conversation interface. The AI client
    will initiate the conversation based on their persona. Your job is to
    respond as you would in a real therapeutic setting.

    Key elements of the conversation interface:

    - **Chat Panel** — Where the conversation happens, with clear message bubbles
    - **Response Input** — Type your responses here and press Enter or click Send
    - **Feedback Sidebar** — Real-time, non-intrusive feedback appears here (you
      can collapse it if preferred)
    - **Session Timer** — Shows elapsed time and remaining suggested duration

  </Step>

  <Step title="Engage with Feedback">
    As you converse, the platform provides real-time feedback in the sidebar:

    - 💚 **Green indicators** — Strong empathic response detected
    - 💛 **Yellow indicators** — Suggestion for improvement
    - 🔴 **Red indicators** — Potential bias or missed crisis signal

    Don't feel pressured to respond to every feedback indicator in real-time.
    Focus on the conversation first — you'll review everything in detail
    afterward.

  </Step>

  <Step title="End and Review">
    When you or the AI client reach a natural conclusion, click **End Session**.
    You'll be taken to the **Session Review** page where you can:

    - Read the full annotated transcript
    - View your empathy score (0–1 scale), bias alerts, and competency breakdown
    - See specific moments highlighted with suggestions for alternative responses
    - Add personal reflections and notes
    - Optionally share the session with your supervisor for feedback

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Learning Goals

After your first session, we recommend setting structured learning goals to
guide your training journey.

### Creating Effective Goals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weekly Practice Goals" icon="calendar-week">
    Set a target for how many sessions you want to complete each week. We recommend:

    - **Beginners**: 2–3 sessions per week
    - **Intermediate**: 3–5 sessions per week
    - **Advanced**: 1–2 focused sessions per week on specific skill gaps

    Consistency matters more than volume. Three thoughtful sessions with full
    review are more valuable than ten rushed ones.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skill-Specific Goals" icon="bullseye">
    Target specific competency scores you want to achieve. For example:

    - "Improve my empathy score from 0.65 to 0.80 within 4 weeks"
    - "Complete 5 crisis intervention scenarios with zero missed crisis signals"
    - "Reduce bias detection alerts by 50% over the next month"

    The platform tracks these goals automatically and sends you progress
    updates.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reflection Goals" icon="book-open">
    Build a habit of self-reflection after each session:

    - Write at least 3 sentences of personal reflection per session
    - Identify one thing you did well and one area for growth
    - Track recurring patterns in your feedback over time

    The **Session Review** page includes guided reflection prompts to help you
    get started.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Goal Dashboard

Access your goals from **Progress → Learning Goals**. The dashboard shows:

- Active goals with progress bars
- Completed goals with achievement dates
- Suggested next goals based on your performance trends
- Supervisor-assigned objectives (if applicable)
