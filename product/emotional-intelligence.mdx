The Emotional Intelligence Engine is the analytical core of Pixelated Empathy.
It processes every message in every training session — classifying emotions,
tracking conversational dynamics, detecting trust and vulnerability, adapting AI
persona behavior, and computing the Empathy PQ score that measures therapeutic
effectiveness. Every other system on the platform depends on it.

## Emotion classification

### Plutchik's Wheel — basic emotions

The engine models emotions using Robert Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of
emotion. Eight primary emotions form the foundation of all emotional analysis:

```typescript
interface EmotionVector {
  joy: number // Happiness, contentment, elation
  sadness: number // Grief, sorrow, melancholy
  anger: number // Frustration, rage, irritation
  fear: number // Anxiety, dread, terror
  surprise: number // Astonishment, shock, wonder
  disgust: number // Revulsion, contempt, aversion
  trust: number // Acceptance, admiration, confidence
  anticipation: number // Expectation, interest, vigilance
}
// All values normalized 0.0 – 1.0
```

Each emotion is scored as a continuous value between 0.0 (absent) and 1.0
(maximum intensity). Multiple emotions can be active simultaneously — a client
discussing a traumatic memory might show high `fear` (0.7), moderate `sadness`
(0.5), low `trust` (0.2), and traces of `anger` (0.15).

<Tip>
  Unlike categorical emotion classifiers that pick a single "winning" emotion,
  Pixelated Empathy's vector-based approach captures the **full emotional
  complexity** of real therapeutic conversations. Humans rarely feel just one
  thing at a time.
</Tip>

### Plutchik's Wheel — advanced (compound emotions)

The advanced model detects **compound emotions** formed by adjacent primary
emotions on Plutchik's wheel:

| Compound Emotion   | Primary Combination  | Clinical Significance              |
| :----------------- | :------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Love**           | Joy + Trust          | Therapeutic alliance, attachment   |
| **Submission**     | Trust + Fear         | Power dynamics, compliance         |
| **Awe**            | Fear + Surprise      | Overwhelm, breakthrough moments    |
| **Disapproval**    | Surprise + Sadness   | Unmet expectations, disappointment |
| **Remorse**        | Sadness + Disgust    | Guilt, shame, self-blame           |
| **Contempt**       | Disgust + Anger      | Devaluation, hostility             |
| **Aggressiveness** | Anger + Anticipation | Escalation risk, confrontation     |
| **Optimism**       | Anticipation + Joy   | Hope, forward-looking, recovery    |

Compound emotions provide richer clinical insight. For example, detecting
`remorse` (sadness + disgust) in a client's language can signal shame — a
critical therapeutic target that might be missed if only the primary emotions
were tracked.

## Dimensional mapping

Beyond categorical emotions, the engine maps every emotional state into a
three-dimensional space using Russell's Circumplex Model extended with a
dominance axis:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Valence">
    **Range: -1.0 to +1.0**

    Measures the positive or negative quality of the emotional experience.

    ```
    Positive valence (+) ← joy, trust, anticipation
    Negative valence (-) ← sadness, anger, fear, disgust
    ```

    **Calculation:**
    ```
    positive = joy + trust + (surprise × 0.5)
    negative = sadness + anger + fear + disgust
    valence  = tanh((positive - negative) / 2)
    ```

    Valence is the most clinically relevant dimension — it directly correlates
    with client wellbeing and session progress.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Arousal">
    **Range: 0.0 to 1.0**

    Measures the activation or energy level of the emotional state.

    ```
    High arousal ← anger, fear, surprise, joy (partially)
    Low arousal  ← sadness, trust, disgust (partially)
    ```

    **Calculation:**
    ```
    highArousal = anger + fear + surprise + (joy × 0.7)
    lowArousal  = sadness + trust + (disgust × 0.5)
    arousal     = clamp((highArousal - lowArousal × 0.3) / 2, 0, 1)
    ```

    High arousal states require careful therapist management — a client in
    high-arousal fear may need grounding before cognitive work is effective.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dominance">
    **Range: -1.0 to +1.0**

    Measures the sense of control or power in the emotional experience.

    ```
    High dominance (+) ← anger, trust, anticipation
    Low dominance (-)  ← fear, sadness, surprise (partially)
    ```

    **Calculation:**
    ```
    dominant   = anger + trust + anticipation
    submissive = fear + sadness + (surprise × 0.5)
    dominance  = tanh((dominant - submissive) / 2)
    ```

    Dominance tracking is essential for detecting power dynamics in the
    therapeutic relationship and identifying clients who feel helpless or
    out of control.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multidimensional emotion map

The three dimensions create a rich emotional space where patterns become visible
over time:

```text
                    High Arousal
                         │
            Angry ●      │      ● Excited
           Afraid ●      │      ● Joyful
                         │
  Low Dominance ─────────┼───────── High Dominance
                         │
          Sad ●           │           ● Content
       Bored ●            │           ● Trusting
                         │
                    Low Arousal
```

The `MultidimensionalEmotionMapper` tracks movement through this space across a
session, detecting:

- **Trends** — Sustained directional movement (e.g., increasing valence =
  improving mood)
- **Cycles** — Repeating emotional patterns (e.g., hope → disappointment loops)
- **Shifts** — Sudden changes in emotional state (e.g., a disclosure that
  triggers fear)
- **Stability** — Emotional consistency or volatility over time

## Personality modeling (Big Five / OCEAN)

The engine uses the Five-Factor Model (Big Five) for personality trait
analysis, calibrating AI persona behavior and recognizing trainee communication
patterns:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Openness to experience" icon="lightbulb">
    **Range: 0.0 – 1.0**

    Measures intellectual curiosity, creativity, and willingness to explore new
    ideas and emotions.

    - **High O** personas: Engage readily with therapeutic metaphors, explore
      emotions with curiosity, welcome novel approaches
    - **Low O** personas: Prefer concrete, structured approaches; may resist
      abstract exploration; value practical solutions

    *Clinical relevance:* Openness influences how a client responds to
    insight-oriented therapy vs. structured behavioral interventions.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conscientiousness" icon="list-check">
    **Range: 0.0 – 1.0**

    Measures self-discipline, organization, and goal-directed behavior.

    - **High C** personas: Complete homework assignments, follow structured
      plans, may struggle with flexibility
    - **Low C** personas: Struggle with follow-through, may benefit from simpler
      plans, need more external structure

    *Clinical relevance:* Conscientiousness predicts homework compliance and
    treatment engagement — critical for CBT and behavioral interventions.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Extraversion" icon="comments">
    **Range: 0.0 – 1.0**

    Measures sociability, assertiveness, and energy derived from social interaction.

    - **High E** personas: Verbose communication style, seek connection readily,
      may use social interaction to avoid emotional depth
    - **Low E** personas: Minimalist communication, need more space and
      patience, depth of processing may be higher but harder to access

    *Clinical relevance:* Extraversion shapes communication style expectations
    and social support utilization.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agreeableness" icon="handshake-simple">
    **Range: 0.0 – 1.0**

    Measures cooperativeness, empathy, and interpersonal warmth.

    - **High A** personas: People-pleasing style, agree readily but may mask
      true feelings, therapeutic alliance forms quickly
    - **Low A** personas: Hostile/resistant style, challenge therapist
      competence, test boundaries — but may ultimately engage more authentically

    *Clinical relevance:* Agreeableness influences the therapeutic alliance
    dynamic and whether resistance is overt or hidden.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Neuroticism" icon="chart-line">
    **Range: 0.0 – 1.0**

    Measures emotional instability, anxiety proneness, and vulnerability to stress.

    - **High N** personas: Emotionally reactive, crisis-escalating potential,
      rapid mood shifts, heightened distress signals
    - **Low N** personas: Emotionally stable, may intellectualize or minimize
      distress, less overt emotional expression

    *Clinical relevance:* Neuroticism is the strongest personality predictor of
    mental health difficulties and treatment response.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  OCEAN traits are used both for **AI persona calibration** (creating realistic,
  consistent client personalities) and for **trainee pattern recognition**
  (identifying a therapist's communication style tendencies and adaptation
  needs).
</Info>

## Conversational dynamics analysis

The engine tracks how emotional patterns evolve across a conversation,
providing real-time insight into the therapeutic process:

### Emotion transitions

The system detects significant emotional transitions — moments when the client's
emotional state shifts meaningfully:

```typescript
interface EmotionTransition {
  from: EmotionDimensions // Starting emotional state
  to: EmotionDimensions // New emotional state
  duration: number // Milliseconds between states
  intensity: number // Magnitude of the shift
  timestamp: string // When the transition occurred
}
```

Transitions are flagged when the Euclidean distance between consecutive
emotional states exceeds a configurable threshold (default: 0.3). Large, rapid
transitions often correspond to clinically significant moments — disclosures,
breakthroughs, or ruptures.

### Emotion clustering

Over the course of a session, the engine clusters emotional states using
k-means clustering to identify dominant emotional themes:

- **Cluster centroid** — The "center of gravity" for each emotional cluster
- **Cluster radius** — How spread out the emotional states are within the cluster
- **Cluster significance** — What proportion of the session was spent in each cluster

For example, a session might reveal three clusters: a large "moderate sadness"
cluster (60% of session), a smaller "engaged trust" cluster (25%), and a brief
"acute fear" cluster (15%) corresponding to a trauma disclosure.

### Temporal smoothing

Raw emotion signals can be noisy. The engine applies exponential moving average
smoothing with a configurable factor (default: 0.3) to produce stable,
clinically meaningful trajectories:

```typescript
smoothed[t] = α × previous[t-1] + (1 - α) × current[t]
```

This produces emotion trajectories that are responsive to real shifts while
filtering out momentary noise.

## Trust and vulnerability detection

Two meta-signals that are critical for therapeutic work but not captured by
standard emotion models:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trust level" icon="shield-heart">
    Computed from the trust emotion vector, therapeutic alliance indicators,
    self-disclosure depth, and consistency of engagement. Rising trust signals
    that the therapeutic relationship is strengthening.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vulnerability level" icon="heart-crack">
    Detected through emotional exposure signals — sharing painful memories,
    expressing shame, admitting fears, or discussing taboo topics. Vulnerability
    indicates the client is engaging in the therapeutic work at a deeper level.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

When the engine detects a **vulnerability spike** — a sudden increase in
emotional exposure — it signals the [Empathy Gym](/product/empathy-gym) feedback
system to closely evaluate the therapist's response. How a therapist responds
to vulnerability is one of the strongest predictors of therapeutic outcome.

## Persona recognition and adaptation

The engine doesn't just analyze the AI client — it also recognizes patterns in
the therapist's communication and adapts accordingly:

### Therapist style recognition

The engine identifies the therapist's dominant communication approach:

| Style           | Indicators                                                 | Adaptation                                                                    |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Directive**   | Frequent advice-giving, closed questions, solution-focused | Persona may become more compliant or more resistant, depending on personality |
| **Reflective**  | Frequent reflections, open questions, emotion-focused      | Persona deepens emotional disclosure, builds trust faster                     |
| **Analytical**  | Cognitive framing, pattern identification, psychoeducation | Persona may intellectualize in response or push for more emotional connection |
| **Supportive**  | Validation-heavy, warm, affirming                          | Persona feels safe to disclose, but may not be challenged to grow             |
| **Challenging** | Confrontation, discrepancy exploration, boundary-setting   | Persona tests limits, may escalate before settling into deeper work           |

### Context-aware emotional synthesis

The `EmotionSynthesizer` creates realistic emotional responses based on
therapeutic context:

```typescript
type EmotionTransitionContext =
  | 'therapist_validates' // → joy↑, sadness↓, anger↓
  | 'therapist_challenges' // → anger↑ initially, then trust↑ if done well
  | 'therapist_reflects' // → trust↑, vulnerability↑
  | 'therapist_neutral' // → minimal change, slight decay
  | 'therapist_empathizes' // → trust↑, sadness may↑ (safe to feel)
  | 'patient_shares_positive' // → joy↑, anticipation↑
  | 'patient_shares_negative' // → sadness↑, fear↑
  | 'patient_discusses_trauma' // → sadness↑↑, fear↑, joy↓
  | 'patient_resists' // → anger↑, trust↓
  | 'goal_achieved' // → joy↑, anticipation↑, trust↑
  | 'setback_experienced' // → sadness↑, anger↑, anticipation↓
```

Each context triggers specific emotion adjustments with configurable decay
factors (default: 0.85 retention per turn), context influence weights, and small
random fluctuations (±2%) that make responses feel organic rather than
mechanical.

## Empathy PQ scoring

The Empathy Performance Quotient (PQ) is Pixelated Empathy's proprietary metric
for measuring therapeutic empathy quality. It is the single most important score
on the platform.

### How it's computed

Empathy PQ integrates signals from multiple analysis dimensions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Response quality analysis">
    Evaluates whether the therapist's response demonstrates understanding of the
    client's emotional state. Measures alignment between detected client
    emotions and the therapist's reflected understanding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Timing and pacing">
    Assesses whether responses are appropriately timed — not too quick
    (suggesting the therapist isn't fully processing) or too slow (suggesting
    disengagement or avoidance).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Technique appropriateness">
    Evaluates whether the therapeutic technique applied matches the clinical
    context. A cognitive restructuring attempt during an acute grief moment
    scores lower than empathic reflection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alliance impact">
    Measures the effect of the therapist's response on the AI persona's trust,
    engagement, and emotional trajectory. Responses that strengthen the alliance
    score higher.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bias deduction">
    Any detected bias signals from the [Bias Detection
    System](/product/bias-detection) reduce the Empathy PQ score proportionally
    to the severity of the bias event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Score interpretation

| PQ Range        | Rating          | Interpretation                                                               |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0.90 – 1.00** | Exceptional     | Consistently deep empathic attunement with skillful technique application    |
| **0.80 – 0.89** | Proficient      | Strong empathic responses with minor areas for refinement (target threshold) |
| **0.70 – 0.79** | Developing      | Adequate empathy with clear growth areas; specific feedback provided         |
| **0.60 – 0.69** | Emerging        | Inconsistent empathic responses; targeted practice recommended               |
| **Below 0.60**  | Needs attention | Significant empathy gaps; structured remediation suggested                   |

<Note>
  The target Empathy PQ threshold is **>0.80**. This represents a level of
  empathic competency that research associates with positive therapeutic
  outcomes. Consistently scoring above 0.80 indicates readiness for more
  challenging scenarios.
</Note>
