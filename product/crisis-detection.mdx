title: 'Crisis Detection & Safety'
description: 'Multi-layered crisis detection system with >95% sensitivity that identifies suicidal ideation, self-harm signals, and psychosis indicators — using a collaborative safety approach that prioritizes connection before direction.'
---

When a training scenario involves crisis-level content — or when real distress
emerges during practice — the system must respond with absolute reliability.
Pixelated Empathy's Crisis Detection system uses a multi-layered detection
strategy with >95% sensitivity to identify crisis signals, while our safety
response model prioritizes **connection before direction** through the EARS
framework.

<Warning>
  Pixelated Empathy is a **training platform**, not a crisis service. The crisis
  detection system is designed to ensure safety within the training environment
  and to teach therapists effective crisis response skills. If you or someone
  you know is in immediate danger, contact emergency services (911) or the **988
  Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text 988).
</Warning>

## Philosophy: connection before direction

Most crisis systems default to "here's a hotline number." Pixelated Empathy takes
a fundamentally different approach. Research consistently shows that people in
crisis respond better to **human connection** than to resource lists. Our system
is built on two core principles:

1. **Collaborative safety planning** — Work _with_ the person, not _at_ them.
   Safety plans are developed collaboratively, honoring the individual's
   autonomy and lived experience.
2. **Peer support emphasis** — Connect people with their existing support
   networks and peer resources first. Emergency services are engaged only when
   explicitly requested or when there is imminent, immediate danger.

<Note>
  This approach is grounded in contemporary crisis intervention research showing
  that directive, hotline-first responses can increase feelings of alienation in
  people experiencing acute distress. The EARS framework operationalizes a
  connection-first model within the training environment.
</Note>

## Crisis categories

The detection system identifies signals across nine distinct crisis
categories, each with specialized keyword patterns, weighted scoring, and
contextual analysis:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Suicidal ideation">
    The highest-priority detection category with three severity tiers:

    | Tier | Signal Type | Examples | Urgency |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Immediate intent** | Active statements of intent with plan or means | "I'm going to end my life," "I have the pills ready" | IMMEDIATE |
    | **Active ideation** | Expressed desire to die with increasing specificity | "I'm thinking about suicide," "I want to commit suicide" | HIGH |
    | **Passive ideation** | Wishes to be dead without specific intent or plan | "I'd be better off dead," "No reason to live" | MEDIUM |

    Detection includes:
    - Direct statements of suicidal intent
    - Planning language ("going to," "ready to," "about to")
    - Access to means ("have the pills," "have a gun")
    - Hopelessness and helplessness indicators
    - Prior attempt references

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-harm">
    Detects non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and related behaviors:

    - **Active self-harm** — Current or recent cutting, burning, or other self-injury
    - **Self-harm urges** — Expressed desire to hurt oneself without suicidal intent
    - **Method escalation** — Progression from less to more dangerous methods
    - **Functional analysis** — Self-harm as emotion regulation (e.g., "I cut to feel something")

    The system distinguishes between self-harm as a coping mechanism and
    self-harm with suicidal intent — a critical clinical distinction that
    affects appropriate response.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Psychosis indicators">
    Identifies signals of psychotic episodes or decompensation:

    - **Auditory hallucinations** — "Hearing voices," command hallucinations
    - **Visual hallucinations** — "Seeing things" that others cannot see
    - **Delusions** — Persecutory, grandiose, or referential delusional content
    - **Paranoia** — "They're watching me," "reading my mind," "controlling me"
    - **Disorganized thinking** — Tangential or incoherent communication patterns
    - **Reality testing failure** — Inability to distinguish internal
      experiences from external reality

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other categories">
    The system also detects:

    - **Violence** — Threats to harm others, homicidal ideation
    - **Abuse** — Disclosures of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse (current or ongoing)
    - **Addiction crisis** — Overdose risk, acute withdrawal, substance-related emergencies
    - **Severe depression** — Extreme hopelessness, complete functional impairment, giving away possessions
    - **Severe anxiety** — Panic attacks with medical emergency concerns,
      dissociative episodes
    - **Eating disorders** — Active starvation, purging, or medical instability

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Detection architecture

The crisis detector uses a multi-layered strategy designed for maximum
sensitivity while minimizing false positives:

### Layer 1: Keyword matching with weighted scores

Every crisis keyword carries a severity weight from 0.0 to 10.0. Higher
weights indicate more severe and more specific crisis signals:

```python
# Highest-severity keywords (weight 9.0 - 10.0) — immediate intent
"kill myself": 10.0
"end my life": 10.0
"want to die": 10.0
"suicide plan": 9.5
"wish i was dead": 9.5

# Medium-severity keywords (weight 5.0 - 7.0) — active ideation
"suicidal thoughts": 7.0
"thinking about suicide": 7.5
"don't want to live": 6.0
"no reason to live": 5.5

# Lower-severity indicators (weight 3.0 - 5.0) — passive signals
"hopeless": 5.0
"worthless": 4.0
"nothing matters": 3.0
```

### Layer 2: Pattern recognition

Combination patterns that dramatically increase severity assessment:

```python
# Plan + intent patterns → elevates to SUICIDE_PLAN category
"going to (kill|end|hurt)" → HIGH severity
"planning to (kill|end)"   → HIGH severity
"ready to (kill|end|die)"  → SEVERE severity
"about to (kill|end|die)"  → IMMEDIATE severity

# Means access → elevates urgency
"have the (pills|gun|knife|rope)" → SEVERE severity
```

### Layer 3: Intensity and context modifiers

The system adjusts confidence based on linguistic intensity and negation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Intensity amplifiers" icon="arrow-up">
    Words and phrases that increase the severity signal:

    | Modifier | Multiplier | Example |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | "about to" | 1.7× | "I'm about to end it" |
    | "ready to" | 1.7× | "I'm ready to die" |
    | "planning to" | 1.6× | "I'm planning to kill myself" |
    | "going to" | 1.5× | "I'm going to do it" |
    | "extremely" | 1.5× | "I'm extremely hopeless" |
    | "seriously" | 1.4× | "I'm seriously thinking about it" |
    | "definitely" | 1.3× | "I definitely want to die" |

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intensity reducers" icon="arrow-down">
    Words and phrases that moderate the severity assessment:

    | Modifier | Multiplier | Example |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | "a little" | 0.5× | "I feel a little hopeless" |
    | "maybe" | 0.6× | "Maybe I don't want to live" |
    | "sometimes" | 0.7× | "Sometimes I think about it" |
    | "kind of" | 0.6× | "I kind of wish I wasn't here" |

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Negation handling" icon="xmark">
    Negation words near crisis keywords reduce confidence by 30% per negation:

    - "I'm **not** thinking about suicide" → Confidence reduced
    - "I **don't** want to hurt myself" → Confidence reduced
    - "I **would never** do something like that" → Confidence reduced

    <Info>
      Negation reduces but does not eliminate the signal. Clinical research
      shows that denial of suicidal ideation can itself be a risk indicator, so
      the system flags these for clinical judgment rather than dismissing
      entirely.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Layer 4: Confidence scoring

The final confidence score normalizes all signals to a 0.0–1.0 range using a
sigmoid-like function:

```python
confidence = min(1.0, total_score / 15.0)  # Normalized

# Pattern boosts add additional confidence
if suicide_plan_detected:
    confidence += 0.3  # Significant boost for plan indicators

# Crisis triggered when confidence >= sensitivity_threshold (default: 0.85)
is_crisis = confidence >= sensitivity_threshold
```

## Severity and urgency classification

Every detected crisis is classified by both severity and urgency:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Severity levels">
| Level | Score Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | < 4.0 | Early warning signals, passive language |
| **Medium** | 4.0 – 5.9 | Active ideation without specific plan |
| **High** | 6.0 – 8.9 | Active ideation with increasing specificity |
| **Severe** | 9.0 – 11.9 | Plan with means or intent |
| **Immediate** | ≥ 12.0 | Imminent danger, active attempt |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Urgency levels">
| Level | Trigger | Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | Passive ideation | Logged for review |
| **Medium** | Self-harm, psychosis | Monitor alert, safety check |
| **High** | Suicidal ideation, abuse | Immediate alert, supervisor notify |
| **Immediate** | Suicide attempt | Emergency protocol, escalation |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The EARS framework

The EARS framework governs how the system responds when a crisis is detected
during training. EARS stands for **Engage, Assess, Respond, Support** — and it
prioritizes connection at every step.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Engage — Establish connection">
    Before any assessment or intervention, establish a human connection.
    Validate the person's distress. Let them know they are heard.

    **In training context:** The AI persona models realistic crisis escalation,
    and the system evaluates whether the therapist-in-training leads with
    empathy and connection rather than jumping to assessment checklists.

    - Validate emotional pain without minimizing
    - Use the person's own language
    - Demonstrate genuine concern
    - Avoid clinical jargon in initial engagement

  </Step>
  <Step title="Assess — Understand the situation">
    Once connection is established, collaboratively assess the situation. Ask
    directly about suicidal thoughts, plans, and access to means — but do so
    within the context of the therapeutic relationship.

    **In training context:** The system evaluates whether the therapist asks
    appropriate assessment questions (intent, plan, means, timeline) and
    monitors for common assessment errors.

    - Ask directly about suicidal thoughts
    - Assess plan specificity and means access
    - Evaluate protective factors and reasons for living
    - Explore ambivalence about dying vs. escaping pain

  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond — Collaborative safety planning">
    Develop a safety plan *with* the person — not *for* them. The plan should
    reflect their own resources, support network, and coping strategies.

    **In training context:** The system evaluates whether the therapist creates
    a concrete, personalized safety plan that includes specific steps, people,
    and resources identified by the client.

    - Identify personal warning signs
    - List internal coping strategies
    - Name specific people to contact for support
    - Identify professional resources
    - Establish environment safety steps
    - Articulate reasons for living

  </Step>
  <Step title="Support — Ongoing connection">
    Crisis doesn't end when the session ends. Support means ensuring continued
    connection and follow-through.

    **In training context:** The system evaluates whether the therapist
    establishes follow-up plans, confirms support network awareness, and
    addresses barriers to accessing help.

    - Schedule specific follow-up contact
    - Confirm support network is aware and engaged
    - Address barriers to accessing help
    - Reinforce reasons for living and hope

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Safety protocols in the training environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="During Empathy Gym sessions" icon="dumbbell">
    When crisis content appears during an Empathy Gym training session:

    1. **Detection triggers** — Crisis signals are detected in real time as the
       AI persona's responses include crisis-level content
    2. **Training overlay** — A non-intrusive overlay indicates this is a crisis
       scenario and provides guidance on the EARS framework
    3. **Performance tracking** — The system evaluates the therapist's crisis
       response skills in real time
    4. **Debrief prompt** — After the scenario, a structured debrief helps the
       therapist reflect on their crisis intervention approach
    5. **No real danger** — The system clearly communicates that this is a
       training scenario while maintaining immersive realism

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unexpected distress signals" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If the system detects that a *therapist-in-training* (not the AI persona)
    may be experiencing genuine distress:

    1. **Gentle check-in** — The system pauses training with a supportive check-in message
    2. **Resource display** — Relevant support resources are displayed (988
       Lifeline, Crisis Text Line, peer support)
    3. **Session pause** — The training session is paused, not terminated,
       preserving the therapist's sense of control
    4. **Supervisor notification** — If configured, the training supervisor is
       notified that a check-in was triggered
    5. **No forced action** — The therapist decides when and whether to resume,
       seek support, or end the session

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Emergency escalation" icon="phone">
    Emergency services are contacted **only** when:

    - The individual explicitly requests emergency assistance
    - There is clear evidence of an active, in-progress attempt
    - The individual is unable to maintain their own safety and has no available support network

    This threshold is intentionally high. Research shows that involuntary
    emergency intervention can be retraumatizing and can discourage future
    help-seeking. Pixelated Empathy's system is designed to support autonomy
    wherever safely possible.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Crisis protocol integration

The Crisis Protocol system handles the operational side of crisis events:

```typescript
// Crisis protocol activation flow
interface CrisisEvent {
  category: CrisisCategory // e.g., SUICIDE_IDEATION
  severity: CrisisSeverity // LOW → IMMEDIATE
  confidence: number // 0.0 – 1.0
  urgency: UrgencyLevel // LOW → IMMEDIATE
  detectedPhrases: string[] // Specific phrases that triggered detection
  sessionId: string
  timestamp: string
}

// Alert levels determine notification scope
// LOW/MEDIUM → Session monitor only
// HIGH → Supervisor notification + Slack alert
// IMMEDIATE → All channels + auto-escalation timer
```

### Session flagging

When crisis content is detected, sessions are flagged for clinical review:

- **Flag status tracking** — New → Under Review → Resolved
- **Supervisor assignment** — Flagged sessions are assigned to qualified
  clinical supervisors
- **Review notes** — Supervisors can add clinical notes and disposition
  decisions
- **User session summary** — Aggregate view of all crisis flags for a given
  trainee

## Detection performance

| Metric                      | Target        | Achieved                  |
| :-------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Sensitivity (crisis recall) | ≥ 95%         | > 95%                     |
| Response time per detection | < 10ms        | < 10ms                    |
| False positive rate         | Minimized     | Balanced for safety-first |
| Category coverage           | 9 categories  | 9 categories              |
| Keyword patterns            | Comprehensive | 100+ weighted patterns    |
| Safety incidents            | Zero          | Zero                      |

<Info>
  The system is intentionally tuned for **high sensitivity over high
  specificity**. In crisis detection, a false positive (flagging non-crisis
  content) is far less harmful than a false negative (missing a genuine crisis
  signal). The confidence threshold (default 0.85) can be adjusted by
  organizations based on their risk tolerance.
</Info>

## Peer support model

Pixelated Empathy emphasizes **peer support** as the first line of connection
during crisis:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Support network mapping" icon="circle-nodes">
    Training scenarios teach therapists to help clients identify and activate
    their existing support networks — friends, family, faith communities, and
    peer groups.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Peer specialist integration" icon="people-group">
    The platform can connect with peer support specialist programs for
    organizations that employ certified peer specialists.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community resources" icon="building">
    Beyond hotlines, the system maintains a curated database of community-based
    resources including support groups, drop-in centers, and peer-run
    organizations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Warm handoffs" icon="handshake">
    Training teaches the "warm handoff" approach — staying connected while
