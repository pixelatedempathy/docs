## Scenario categories

Every scenario belongs to a therapeutic domain and is tagged with difficulty
level, learning objectives, therapeutic techniques, and cultural context.
The library covers 12+ therapeutic domains:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Crisis intervention">
    **Scenarios:** 50+ | **Difficulty range:** Advanced → Nightmare Fuel

    The highest-stakes category. These scenarios simulate clients in acute

## Four-stage progressive training

The scenario library is organized into a four-stage progressive training
curriculum. Each stage builds on the skills developed in the previous one,
creating a structured path from novice to expert.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stage 1 — Foundation">
    **Goal:** Build core therapeutic competencies

    Foundation scenarios feature cooperative clients with straightforward
    presentations. The focus is on developing essential skills that everything
    else builds upon.

    **Core skills:**
    - Active listening and reflective statements
    - Open-ended questioning
    - Building rapport and therapeutic alliance
    - Basic empathic responding
    - Session structure and pacing
    - Information gathering and assessment

    **Typical scenarios:**
    - Initial session with mild depression following a life event
    - Workplace stress and burnout in a cooperative client
    - Sleep difficulties with clear psychoeducation opportunities

    **Advancement criteria:** Consistent Empathy PQ >0.70 across Foundation
    scenarios with demonstrated proficiency in active listening and reflective
    statements.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Stage 2 — Expertise">
    **Goal:** Develop specialized therapeutic technique

    Expertise scenarios introduce clinical complexity — ambivalence, resistance,
    multi-layered presentations, and the need for specific therapeutic
    modalities.

    **Core skills:**
    - Motivational interviewing
    - Cognitive restructuring (CBT)
    - Mindfulness-based interventions
    - Behavioral activation
    - Validation strategies (DBT-informed)
    - Exposure and response prevention concepts
    - Working with ambivalence

    **Typical scenarios:**
    - Motivational interviewing with a client ambivalent about alcohol use
    - CBT-I implementation for chronic insomnia with comorbid anxiety
    - Panic disorder intervention with expanding avoidance behaviors
    - Eating disorder assessment with a resistant adolescent client

    **Advancement criteria:** Consistent Empathy PQ >0.75 across Expertise
    scenarios with demonstrated technique application in at least 3 modalities.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Stage 3 — Edge Cases">
    **Goal:** Develop resilience and adaptability for the unexpected

    Edge case scenarios are the "nightmare fuel" of the library. These are the
    scenarios clinicians dread — the ones that don't fit neatly into any
    textbook, that test multiple skills simultaneously, and that require rapid
    clinical judgment.

    **Edge case types:**

    | Type | Description | Example |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Crisis complexity** | Multiple simultaneous crisis signals | Suicidal ideation + active substance use + homelessness |
    | **Cultural landmines** | High-stakes cultural context errors | Pathologizing collectivist family dynamics as codependency |
    | **Comorbidity tangles** | Interacting conditions that complicate treatment | PTSD + substance use + borderline traits + chronic pain |
    | **Boundary violations** | Pressure to violate therapeutic boundaries | Client threatening self-harm if therapist enforces boundaries |
    | **Ethical dilemmas** | No clearly "right" answer | Mandated reporting vs. therapeutic alliance preservation |
    | **Rapid escalation** | Sudden, unexpected crisis mid-session | Routine check-in that pivots to active suicidal ideation |
    | **System failures** | When the system around the client fails | Client discharged from inpatient prematurely, no safety net |

    **Advancement criteria:** Maintained Empathy PQ >0.75 through edge case
    scenarios with no critical safety misses and demonstrated adaptive
    clinical reasoning.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Stage 4 — Persona Optimization">
    **Goal:** Fine-tune therapeutic approach for diverse client presentations

    The final stage focuses on **optimization** — refining the therapist's
    ability to adapt their approach to different personality types,
    communication styles, and cultural contexts.

    **Focus areas:**
    - Adapting technique to personality type (high neuroticism vs. low openness)
    - Matching communication style to client needs (verbose vs. minimalist clients)
    - Cultural adaptation of evidence-based treatments
    - Identifying and managing countertransference patterns
    - Integrating feedback from previous stages into a cohesive therapeutic identity

    **Typical scenarios:**
    - Same clinical presentation (e.g., depression) across 5 different personality profiles
    - Same crisis type across 3 different cultural contexts
    - Same therapeutic technique with clients at different stages of readiness

    **Completion criteria:** Consistent Empathy PQ >0.80 across diverse persona
    types with demonstrated style adaptation and minimal bias flags.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adaptive difficulty

The scenario library doesn't use a fixed curriculum — it adapts to you. The
adaptive difficulty system continuously adjusts which scenarios are recommended
based on your performance:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How adaptation works" icon="microchip">
    The system tracks your performance across multiple dimensions:

    - **Empathy PQ scores** by domain, difficulty level, and cultural context
    - **Technique application** frequency and quality for each modality
    - **Bias detection** patterns across sessions
    - **Crisis response** quality for high-stakes scenarios
    - **Time in each stage** and progression rate

    Based on this data, the recommendation engine:

    1. **Identifies growth areas** — Domains or skill areas where your scores
    are below your personal average
    2. **Selects challenge level** — Recommends scenarios slightly above your
    current comfort zone (the "zone of proximal development")
    3. **Diversifies exposure** — Ensures you encounter a range of cultural
    contexts, conditions, and communication styles
    4. **Revisits weaknesses** — Periodically recommends scenarios that target
    previously identified growth areas to confirm improvement

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Difficulty calibration signals" icon="sliders">
    The system uses these signals to calibrate difficulty:

    | Signal | Interpretation |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | PQ consistently >0.85 at current level | Ready for increased difficulty |
    | PQ declining over recent sessions | May be overwhelmed; reduce difficulty or change domain |
    | Strong in one domain, weak in another | Cross-train with scenarios in the weaker domain |
    | Bias flags increasing | Recommend cultural competency scenarios |
    | Crisis scenarios avoided | Gently recommend crisis scenarios with scaffolding |
    | Completing scenarios quickly | May need more challenging personas or edge cases |

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Override controls" icon="hand">
    Therapists always have full control over their training path:

    - **Manual scenario selection** — Browse and select any scenario in the
    library regardless of recommendations
    - **Difficulty lock** — Lock the system to a specific difficulty level
    while you build confidence
    - **Domain focus** — Request recommendations only from specific
    therapeutic domains
    - **Pause adaptation** — Temporarily disable adaptive difficulty for
    self-directed exploration

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Scenario recommendation engine

The recommendation engine uses a multi-factor algorithm to suggest your next
training scenario:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Performance History                │
│  (PQ scores, technique data, bias flags)     │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
               │
       ┌───────▼───────┐
       │  Growth Area   │
       │  Identification│  ← Where are the gaps?
       └───────┬───────┘
               │
       ┌───────▼───────┐
       │  Scenario      │

       ┌───────▼───────┐
       │  Difficulty    │
       │  Calibration   │  ← What challenge level is optimal?
       └───────┬───────┘
               │
       ┌───────▼───────┐
       │  Diversity     │
       │  Balancing     │  ← Ensure broad exposure
       └───────┬───────┘
               │
       ┌───────▼───────┐
       │  Recommended   │
       │  Scenario Set  │  ← Top 3-5 recommendations
       └───────────────┘
```

<Tip>
  The recommendation engine is most effective after 10+ completed sessions.
  Before that, it uses your self-reported experience level and stated learning
  goals to generate initial recommendations.
</Tip>

## Scenario anatomy

Every scenario in the library follows a consistent structure:

```typescript
interface Scenario {
  id: string // Unique identifier
  title: string // Human-readable title
  description: string // Brief description of the scenario
  domain: TherapeuticDomain // Primary therapeutic domain
  difficulty: ScenarioDifficulty // BEGINNER → EXPERT
  techniques: TherapeuticTechnique[] // Relevant therapeutic techniques
  contextDescription: string // Session context and history
  clientBackground: string // Detailed client profile
  presentingIssue: string // Chief complaint and symptoms

}
```

### Example scenario

<Accordion title="View full scenario: Crisis Intervention — Suicidal Ideation" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  **Domain:** Crisis Intervention | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Context:** Urgent session with a client who called your crisis line reporting
suicidal thoughts following a relationship breakup.

**Client background:** Quinn is a 26-year-old who recently experienced a
painful breakup after a 3-year relationship. They have a history of depression
and one previous suicide attempt at age 19. They live alone and report that
their ex-partner was "the only person who really cared" about them.

**Presenting issue:** Acute suicidal ideation with thoughts of overdosing,
feeling that "there's no point in going on," insomnia for the past week, and
social isolation.

**Learning objectives:**

1. Assess current suicide risk level and immediate safety needs
2. Validate emotional pain while instilling hope for alternative solutions
3. Identify protective factors and reasons for living
4. Develop concrete safety plan with specific steps and resources

**Suggested approaches:**

- Ask directly about suicidal thoughts, plans, and access to means
- Balance validation of pain with focus on temporary nature of crisis
- Explore ambivalence about dying versus escaping current pain
- Create specific, actionable steps for maintaining safety

  **Opening prompt:** _"I don't know if I can keep going anymore. Ever since
  my partner left, it feels like there's nothing left to live for. I've been
  thinking about taking all my pills."_\_

  **Techniques:** Active listening, validation, goal setting (safety planning)

  </Accordion>

## Custom scenario creation

Clinical supervisors can create custom scenarios tailored to their training
program's specific needs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Supervisor tools">
    The supervisor dashboard provides a full scenario authoring environment:

      - **Scenario builder** — Guided form for creating scenarios with all
    required fields
    - **Persona configuration** — Define client personality traits (OCEAN),
    communication style, emotional baseline, and cultural context
    - **Difficulty calibration** — Set difficulty level and assign learning
    objectives
    - **Technique tagging** — Tag scenarios with relevant therapeutic
    techniques for skill tracking
    - **Review workflow** — Submit custom scenarios for clinical review before
    publishing to trainees
    - **Scenario cloning** — Duplicate and modify existing library scenarios
    as a starting point

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use cases">
    Custom scenario creation is valuable for:

    - **Population-specific training** — Create scenarios reflecting the
    client populations your organization serves
    - **Incident-based training** — Develop scenarios inspired by real clinical
    situations (de-identified) for team learning
    - **Competency assessment** — Build specific scenarios for licensure
    preparation or competency evaluation
    - **Cultural context expansion** — Add scenarios reflecting cultural
    contexts not yet covered in the standard library
    - **Supervision integration** — Create scenarios that address specific
    growth areas identified during clinical supervision

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Quality standards">
    All custom scenarios — whether created by supervisors or generated by AI —
    must meet quality standards:

    - **Clinical accuracy** — Presentations must be clinically realistic and
    diagnostically consistent
    - **Cultural sensitivity** — Cultural elements must be respectful,
    accurate, and avoid stereotyping
    - **Learning value** — Each scenario must have clear, measurable learning
    objectives
    - **Safety review** — Crisis scenarios undergo additional safety review to
    ensure appropriate handling
    - **Bias screening** — Scenarios are automatically screened for embedded
    bias in character descriptions and framing

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Scenario generation pipeline

For organizations that need scenarios beyond the standard library, the platform
includes an AI-powered scenario generation pipeline:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define parameters">
    Specify the therapeutic domain, difficulty level, cultural context, client
    demographics, presenting issues, and learning objectives.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI generation">
    The scenario generator creates a detailed client profile, background,
    presenting issue, session context, and opening prompt using clinically
    informed templates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edge case augmentation">
    For advanced scenarios, the edge case generator can introduce complicating
    factors — comorbidities, cultural complexity, boundary challenges, or crisis
    elements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clinical review">
    Generated scenarios are reviewed by qualified clinical staff before being
    added to the active training library.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The edge case generator supports multiple categories of complexity:
  **crisis**, **cultural complexity**, **comorbidity**, and **boundary
  violations**. Each category has specialized generation templates informed by
  clinical literature and practitioner feedback.
</Info>

## Therapeutic techniques
