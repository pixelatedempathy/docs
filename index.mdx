## 🎯 What Happens Here

Imagine a world where every caregiver — therapist, counselor, crisis hotline
volunteer — has practiced the most difficult conversations of their career a
thousand times before meeting a real person in pain.

**That's The Empathy Gym™.**

We're not building chatbots. We're building **empathy infrastructure** — the
systems that help humans become better at the most important skill there is:
*connecting with other humans when it matters most.*
