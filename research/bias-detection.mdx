title: 'Bias Detection'
description: "Even well-intentioned AI can carry prejudice it doesn't know about."

## The Problem

Every AI system inherits biases from the data it's trained on, the
frameworks it implements, and the assumptions its creators make. In
a platform that models human emotion, these biases aren't abstract
concerns — they directly affect how realistic, fair, and useful our
simulations are.

If our emotional models assume that "normal" grief looks a certain
way, we'll train therapists to recognize one kind of grief and miss
others. If our crisis detection is calibrated to one cultural
expression of distress, it'll fail for others.

We can't eliminate bias entirely. But we can — and do — work
systematically to detect it, measure it, and mitigate it.

## Where Bias Lives in Our System

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Training Data" icon="database">
    Our emotional models are trained on datasets that reflect the biases
    of their sources. Published psychological research is predominantly
    Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD). We
    know this. We account for it.

    **What we do**: We actively seek data from diverse sources. We weight
    our training data to avoid over-representing any single demographic.
    We flag findings that haven't been validated cross-culturally.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Emotional Frameworks" icon="chart-pie">
    Plutchik's Wheel and the Big Five were both developed primarily
    within Western academic psychology. While both have reasonable
    cross-cultural validation, neither is universally applicable without
    adaptation.

    **What we do**: We treat cultural variation as a feature, not a bug.
    Our models include cultural context as an explicit variable in
    emotional assessment. An expression of distress that's indirect in
    one culture might be direct in another — our models account for
    this.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Therapeutic Evaluation" icon="comments">
    "Good therapy" is culturally influenced. Motivational Interviewing
    emphasizes individual autonomy — a value more prominent in
    individualistic cultures than collectivist ones. Person-centered
    therapy assumes that emotional disclosure is therapeutic, which
    isn't universally true.

    **What we do**: Our evaluation system doesn't assume one therapeutic
    style is universally correct. We assess technique within context,
    and we're transparent about the cultural framework we're operating
    within.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Language Processing" icon="language">
    Natural language processing models carry linguistic biases.
    Sentiment analysis trained primarily on English text will perform
    differently on other languages, dialects, and communication styles.

    **What we do**: We test our NLP components across diverse language
    patterns and flag performance discrepancies.

## Our Bias Detection Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Proactive Auditing">
    Before deploying any new model or feature, we run it through
    bias checks:

    - **Demographic parity** — Does the model perform equally across
      demographic groups?
    - **Cultural sensitivity** — Does it handle diverse emotional
      expressions appropriately?
    - **Language bias** — Does it favor certain communication styles
      over others?

  </Step>

  <Step title="Continuous Monitoring">
    In production, we watch for:

    - Patterns in crisis detection across demographic groups
    - Systematic differences in therapeutic evaluation scores
    - User feedback indicating culturally inappropriate responses

  </Step>

  <Step title="Human Review">
    AI can detect statistical anomalies, but understanding whether
    those anomalies represent bias requires human judgment. We
    maintain review processes that include:

    - Subject-matter experts in cross-cultural psychology
    - Community feedback channels
    - Regular team reflection on assumptions and blind spots

  </Step>
</Steps>

## What We've Learned

Being honest about what we've found:

<Warning>
  These are known limitations we are actively working to address. Transparency
  about bias is more valuable than pretending it doesn't exist.

  <Card title="Our emotional taxonomy is Western-centric" icon="globe">
    Plutchik's Wheel was developed in a Western context. Some emotions that are
    primary in other cultures (like "amae" in Japanese — a feeling of pleasant
    dependence) don't map cleanly onto it. We're exploring extensions to address
    this.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Silence is culturally loaded" icon="volume-xmark">
    We model silence as a therapeutic tool, but the meaning of silence varies
    enormously across cultures. In some contexts, it's reflective. In others, it
    signals discomfort, respect, or disagreement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Crisis signals differ" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Direct statements of self-harm intent are more common in some cultural
    contexts than others. Our crisis detection must be sensitive to both direct
    and indirect expressions of distress.

## Transparency

We believe transparency about bias is more valuable than pretending
it doesn't exist. When we identify a bias in our system, we:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document It">Publicly in our research notes.</Step>
  <Step title="Assess Impact">How does this affect users?</Step>
  <Step title="Prioritize Mitigation">Based on impact severity.</Step>
  <Step title="Track Progress">Report on improvements.</Step>
  <Step title="Stay Honest">About what we haven't solved yet.</Step>
</Steps>

## The Bigger Picture

Bias detection isn't a launch requirement — it's an ongoing practice.
We'll never be completely bias-free, and claiming otherwise would be
dishonest.

What we can do is build systems that are aware of their limitations,
transparent about their assumptions, and actively working to improve.

That's the standard we hold ourselves to.
