## The Principle

We don't invent psychology. We translate it.

Every emotional model, therapeutic technique, and behavioral pattern
in our platform is rooted in established psychological research.
Peer-reviewed. Clinically validated. Actually tested on humans.

This matters because we're building tools for mental health
professionals — people who will notice immediately if we cut corners
on the science.

## The Frameworks We Use

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    title="Plutchik's Psychoevolutionary Theory (1980)"
    icon="palette"
  >
    Robert Plutchik proposed that emotions evolved as adaptive
    responses, organized into a wheel-like structure with eight
    primary emotions at varying intensities. This gives us a
    structured, nuanced emotional taxonomy — not a simplified
    "positive/negative" binary.

    **Why we chose it**: It handles intensity gradients (annoyance
    vs. rage) and composite emotions (joy + trust = love), which
    are critical for realistic therapeutic simulations.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
    title="Big Five Personality Model (Costa & McCrae, 1992)"
    icon="user-group"
  >
    The five-factor model (OCEAN) is the most widely accepted
    framework for personality assessment in modern psychology. We
    use it to give simulated clients stable personality foundations
    that influence how they express emotion, respond to
    interventions, and build trust.

    **Why we chose it**: Cross-cultural validity, strong empirical
    support, and practical applicability to therapeutic contexts.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
    title="Motivational Interviewing (Miller & Rollnick)"
    icon="comments"
  >
    A directive, client-centered counseling approach that helps
    resolve ambivalence and guide people toward behavioral change.
    We use its principles to evaluate therapist responses —
    particularly around reflective listening, empathy, and
    resistance management.

    **Why we chose it**: It provides clear, measurable criteria for
    what effective therapeutic communication looks like.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
    title="Person-Centered Therapy (Carl Rogers)"
    icon="heart"
  >
    Rogers' emphasis on unconditional positive regard, empathic
    understanding, and congruence forms the ethical backbone of
    our evaluation system. We don't just measure what therapists
    say — we measure whether they create the conditions for genuine
    connection.

    **Why we chose it**: It's the gold standard for therapeutic
    relationship quality.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
    title="Dialectical Behavior Therapy (Marsha Linehan)"
    icon="scale-balanced"
  >
    DBT's framework for distress tolerance, emotional regulation,
    and interpersonal effectiveness informs how we model crisis
    situations and evaluate crisis intervention skills.

    **Why we chose it**: It provides structured protocols for the
    highest-stakes scenarios in therapeutic practice.

## How We Build Models

<Steps>
  <Step title="Literature Review">
    Every new feature or capability starts with a literature review.
    We examine:

    - Peer-reviewed research in relevant psychological domains
    - Meta-analyses when available
    - Clinical practice guidelines
    - Established measurement instruments

  </Step>

  <Step title="Conceptual Modeling">
    We translate psychological constructs into computational models.
    This requires careful attention to:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="What's measurable vs. aspirational">
        Not every psychological concept can be quantified
        meaningfully. We focus on what can be measured with
        acceptable validity.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="What's validated vs. speculative">
        We draw the line at validated science. If a concept hasn't
        been empirically tested, we flag it clearly and treat it
        with appropriate caution.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="What's generalizable vs. culturally specific">
        Many psychological findings are culturally bound. We identify
        which results generalize and which require cultural
        adaptation.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Implementation and Validation">
    Every model goes through:

    - Internal testing against known scenarios
    - Evaluation by subject-matter experts
    - Bias analysis (see [Bias Detection](/research/bias-detection))
    - Iterative refinement based on user feedback

  </Step>

  <Step title="Ongoing Evaluation">
    Models aren't static. We continuously evaluate:

    - Does the model produce realistic client behavior?
    - Are the therapeutic evaluations accurate?
    - Are there systematic biases we haven't addressed?
    - Does new research suggest improvements?

  </Step>
</Steps>

## What We Don't Do

<Warning>
  These boundaries are non-negotiable. They define what our platform is — and
  what it is not.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="We don't claim diagnostic capability" icon="xmark">
    Our models identify emotional patterns and evaluate therapeutic technique.
    They don't diagnose mental health conditions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="We don't replace clinical expertise" icon="xmark">
    The Empathy Gym™ is a training supplemental tool. It is not a substitute for
    supervision, continuing education, or clinical experience.
  </Card>
  <Card title="We don't publish our own research" icon="xmark">
    We are technology builders, not academic researchers. We implement published
    science, and we're transparent about what's established and what's
    experimental.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Academic Sourcing Pipeline

We maintain an integrated system for therapeutic dataset discovery
and acquisition — the **Journal Research Pipeline**. This system:

- Identifies relevant new publications in emotional intelligence,
  therapeutic technique, and crisis intervention
- Evaluates source quality and relevance
- Feeds validated findings into our model improvement process

<Info>
  This isn't automated literature review (those have well-documented accuracy
  problems). It's curated, expert-guided research integration.
