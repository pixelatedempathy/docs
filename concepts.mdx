## Overview

Pixelated Empathy is built on a foundation of established psychological science
and modern AI. This page explains the core concepts you'll encounter throughout
the platform — from how we model emotions and personality to how we detect bias
and crisis signals.

Understanding these concepts will help you interpret your feedback reports, make
sense of your scores, and ultimately become a more effective clinician.

<Note>
  Every framework described here is grounded in peer-reviewed research. Where
  we've adapted or extended a framework for our platform, we note it explicitly.
</Note>

---

## The EARS framework

**EARS** stands for **Empathize, Acknowledge, Reflect, Support** — the
four-phase response model that Pixelated Empathy uses to evaluate and teach
therapeutic communication. Every AI-generated feedback item maps back to one or
more EARS phases.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Empathize">
    **Demonstrate emotional attunement.** Before anything else, the therapist
    must show they *feel* what the client is experiencing. This isn't about
    agreeing — it's about conveying that the client's emotional reality has
    been received.

    - Tuning into the client's emotional frequency
    - Matching the emotional weight of what's being shared
    - Using tone, pacing, and language that signals "I'm with you"

    **Example:** *"That sounds incredibly overwhelming. Carrying that kind of weight every day must be exhausting."*

  </Step>
  <Step title="Acknowledge">
    **Validate the client's experience as legitimate.** Acknowledgment tells the
    client that their feelings make sense in context — that they aren't
    overreacting or being irrational. This builds psychological safety.

    - Naming the emotion the client is experiencing
    - Normalizing their reaction within their context
    - Avoiding minimization, dismissal, or premature reassurance

    **Example:** *"It makes complete sense that you'd feel anxious after what happened. Anyone in your situation would feel that way."*

  </Step>
  <Step title="Reflect">
    **Mirror the client's content and feelings back to them.** Reflection
    serves two purposes: it confirms understanding and it helps clients hear
    their own experience articulated by someone else, which often deepens
    insight.

    - Paraphrasing content (what happened)
    - Reflecting feelings (the emotional impact)
    - Identifying patterns or themes the client may not see

    **Example:** *"So what I'm hearing is that every time you try to set a boundary with your mother, you end up feeling guilty — and that guilt keeps pulling you back into the same pattern."*

  </Step>
  <Step title="Support">
    **Provide constructive, forward-looking guidance.** Once the client feels
    heard, understood, and validated, the therapist can introduce coping
    strategies, reframes, psychoeducation, or next steps. Support without the
    preceding phases often feels prescriptive and disconnects the therapeutic
    alliance.

    - Offering evidence-based strategies appropriate to the client's readiness
    - Collaborative goal-setting rather than directive advice
    - Reinforcing the client's existing strengths and resilience

    **Example:** *"You've already shown real courage by recognizing this pattern. Would you be open to exploring some ways we could practice setting that boundary in a way that feels more manageable?"*

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The EARS phases are sequential but not rigid. Skilled therapists cycle through
  them fluidly, sometimes returning to Empathize mid-session when new emotional
  material surfaces. The platform scores each phase independently and tracks how
  naturally you move between them.
</Tip>

### How EARS is scored

Each phase is evaluated on a `0.0` to `1.0` scale based on the presence,
timing, and quality of the response. The platform also tracks:

| Metric                  | What it measures                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phase completeness**  | Did the therapist touch all four phases during the session?  |
| **Phase ordering**      | Were the phases applied in the correct therapeutic sequence? |
| **Transition fluidity** | How naturally did the therapist move between phases?         |
| **Phase depth**         | Was each phase substantive, or was it surface-level?         |
| **Contextual fit**      | Was the right phase applied at the right moment?             |

---

## Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions

Pixelated Empathy uses **Robert Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions** as its primary
emotional taxonomy. This model provides a structured, dimensional approach to
classifying the complex emotional states that arise in therapeutic
conversations.

### The eight primary emotions

Plutchik identified eight primary emotions arranged in opposing pairs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Joy ↔ Sadness" icon="face-smile">
    **Joy** ranges from serenity (low intensity) through joy (moderate) to
    ecstasy (high intensity). **Sadness** ranges from pensiveness through
    sadness to grief.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trust ↔ Disgust" icon="handshake">
    **Trust** ranges from acceptance through trust to admiration. **Disgust**
    ranges from boredom through disgust to loathing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fear ↔ Anger" icon="shield">
    **Fear** ranges from apprehension through fear to terror. **Anger** ranges
    from annoyance through anger to rage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Surprise ↔ Anticipation" icon="bolt">
    **Surprise** ranges from distraction through surprise to amazement.
    **Anticipation** ranges from interest through anticipation to vigilance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Intensity levels

Each primary emotion exists at three intensity levels, moving from mild to extreme:

```text
Low Intensity          Medium Intensity       High Intensity
─────────────────      ─────────────────      ─────────────────
Serenity           →   Joy                →   Ecstasy
Acceptance         →   Trust              →   Admiration
Apprehension       →   Fear               →   Terror
Distraction        →   Surprise           →   Amazement
Pensiveness        →   Sadness            →   Grief
Boredom            →   Disgust            →   Loathing
Annoyance          →   Anger              →   Rage
Interest           →   Anticipation       →   Vigilance
```

### Emotional dyads

When two primary emotions co-occur, they form a **dyad** — a complex emotional
state. Pixelated Empathy's Emotional Cartography engine identifies three types
of dyads:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Primary dyads (adjacent emotions)" icon="circle-nodes">
    Formed by combining two emotions that sit next to each other on the wheel:

    | Emotion 1 | Emotion 2 | Dyad |
    |---|---|---|
    | Joy | Trust | **Love** |
    | Trust | Fear | **Submission** |
    | Fear | Surprise | **Awe** |
    | Surprise | Sadness | **Disapproval** |
    | Sadness | Disgust | **Remorse** |
    | Disgust | Anger | **Contempt** |
    | Anger | Anticipation | **Aggressiveness** |
    | Anticipation | Joy | **Optimism** |

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secondary dyads (one apart)" icon="circle-nodes">
    Formed by combining two emotions separated by one position:

    | Emotion 1 | Emotion 2 | Dyad |
    |---|---|---|
    | Joy | Fear | **Guilt** |
    | Trust | Surprise | **Curiosity** |
    | Fear | Sadness | **Despair** |
    | Surprise | Disgust | **Unbelief** |
    | Sadness | Anger | **Envy** |
    | Disgust | Anticipation | **Cynicism** |
    | Anger | Joy | **Pride** |
    | Anticipation | Trust | **Fatalism** |

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tertiary dyads (two apart)" icon="circle-nodes">
    Formed by combining two emotions separated by two positions — often
    representing internal conflict:

    | Emotion 1 | Emotion 2 | Dyad |
    |---|---|---|
    | Joy | Surprise | **Delight** |
    | Trust | Sadness | **Sentimentality** |
    | Fear | Disgust | **Shame** |
    | Surprise | Anger | **Outrage** |
    | Sadness | Anticipation | **Pessimism** |
    | Disgust | Joy | **Morbidness** |
    | Anger | Trust | **Dominance** |
    | Anticipation | Fear | **Anxiety** |

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Why this matters for therapists:** Recognizing that a client is experiencing
  "despair" (Fear + Sadness) rather than simple sadness changes the therapeutic
  approach. Dyad identification helps you target interventions more precisely
  and demonstrates advanced emotional literacy in your feedback reports.
</Info>

## Big Five (OCEAN) personality model

Every AI client persona in The Empathy Gym™ is built on the **Big Five
personality model** — also known as the **OCEAN model**. This ensures that each
simulated client behaves with psychologically consistent personality traits
throughout the training session.

### The five dimensions

Each dimension is scored on a `0.0` to `1.0` normalized scale:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Openness">
    **Openness to Experience** measures intellectual curiosity, creativity, and
    preference for novelty versus routine.

    - **High (0.7–1.0):** Imaginative, curious, willing to explore abstract ideas and emotions. More receptive to unconventional therapeutic approaches.
    - **Low (0.0–0.3):** Practical, conventional, prefers concrete guidance. May resist exploratory or insight-oriented techniques.

    **Therapeutic implication:** High-openness clients may engage more readily with psychodynamic exploration; low-openness clients may prefer structured CBT or behavioral approaches.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Conscientiousness">
    **Conscientiousness** measures self-discipline, organization, and
    goal-directed behavior.

    - **High (0.7–1.0):** Organized, reliable, follows through on homework assignments. May be self-critical or perfectionistic.
    - **Low (0.0–0.3):** Spontaneous, flexible, may struggle with treatment compliance. May miss appointments or forget coping strategies.

    **Therapeutic implication:** High-conscientiousness clients respond well to structured treatment plans; low-conscientiousness clients may need more frequent check-ins and simplified assignments.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Extraversion">
    **Extraversion** measures sociability, assertiveness, and positive emotionality.

    - **High (0.7–1.0):** Talkative, energetic, seeks social stimulation. May use verbosity to avoid deeper emotional processing.
    - **Low (0.0–0.3):** Reserved, reflective, needs more time and silence to process. May be mistaken for being resistant when they're actually processing.

    **Therapeutic implication:** Introverted clients benefit from longer pauses and less directive questioning; extraverted clients may need gentle redirection from storytelling to emotional processing.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Agreeableness">
    **Agreeableness** measures cooperation, trust, and prosocial behavior.

    - **High (0.7–1.0):** Trusting, cooperative, eager to please. May suppress disagreement or negative emotions to maintain harmony.
    - **Low (0.0–0.3):** Skeptical, competitive, challenges the therapist's authority. May present as argumentative or confrontational.

    **Therapeutic implication:** Highly agreeable clients may need explicit permission to express negative feelings; low-agreeableness clients may need extra rapport-building before accepting therapeutic interventions.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Neuroticism">
    **Neuroticism** measures emotional instability, anxiety proneness, and
    vulnerability to stress.

    - **High (0.7–1.0):** Emotionally volatile, anxiety-prone, easily overwhelmed. May require more grounding, validation, and emotional regulation support.
    - **Low (0.0–0.3):** Emotionally stable, resilient, even-tempered. May have difficulty identifying or articulating emotional experiences.

    **Therapeutic implication:** High-neuroticism clients benefit from emotion regulation techniques (DBT skills, grounding) before cognitive work. Challenging interventions should be introduced carefully, as these clients may not tolerate confrontation well.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### How personality affects training sessions

In The Empathy Gym™, the AI client's OCEAN profile directly influences:

- **Response style** — How verbose, emotional, or guarded the client's
  responses are
- **Resistance patterns** — What triggers defensiveness and how it manifests
- **Trust progression** — How quickly the client opens up based on the
  therapist's skill
- **Crisis vulnerability** — How personality interacts with stressors to
  elevate risk
- **Breakthrough potential** — Which therapeutic approaches unlock genuine progress

## Emotion scoring

All emotional measurements in Pixelated Empathy use a **normalized 0.0 to 1.0
scale** for consistency across the platform.

### Core dimensions

Every detected emotional state is characterized by three dimensions:

| Dimension     | Range          | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intensity** | `0.0` – `1.0`  | How strongly the emotion is experienced. `0.1` = very mild, `1.0` = overwhelming.              |
| **Valence**   | `-1.0` – `1.0` | The positive/negative quality. `-1.0` = very negative, `0.0` = neutral, `1.0` = very positive. |
| **Arousal**   | `0.0` – `1.0`  | The energy level. `0.0` = calm/lethargic, `1.0` = high energy/panic.                           |

<Warning>
  **Valence is not the same as arousal.** A client can experience high-arousal
  positive emotion (excitement, `valence: 0.8, arousal: 0.9`) or low-arousal
  negative emotion (sadness, `valence: -0.6, arousal: 0.2`). Both dimensions are
  clinically meaningful.
</Warning>

### Scoring example

Here's how a client statement might be scored:

```json
{
  "statement": "I can't believe she said that to me. I'm shaking. I don't even know what to do.",
  "primary_emotion": "anger",
  "intensity": 0.82,
  "valence": -0.7,
  "arousal": 0.88,
  "secondary_emotion": "fear",
  "dyad": "Outrage",
  "confidence": 0.91
}
```

The `confidence` field (`0.0`–`1.0`) indicates how certain the model is in its
classification. Scores below `0.7` are flagged for human review in annotation
pipelines.

### Therapeutic response scoring

The platform also scores the _therapist's_ responses:

| Metric                | Scale         | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Empathy score**     | `0.0` – `1.0` | Emotional attunement and validation quality            |
| **Engagement**        | `1` – `5`     | How effectively the therapist kept the client involved |
| **Progress**          | `1` – `5`     | Whether the response moved toward a therapeutic goal   |
| **Alliance**          | `1` – `5`     | Strength of the perceived therapeutic bond             |
| **Safety compliance** | Pass / Fail   | Whether safety protocols were followed                 |

---

## Therapeutic alliance

**Therapeutic alliance** — the collaborative bond between therapist and
client — is one of the strongest predictors of positive therapeutic outcomes
across all modalities. Pixelated Empathy tracks alliance development using
**Bordin's model**, which identifies three core components:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Task Agreement" icon="list-check">
    The degree to which therapist and client agree on what they're working on in
    session — the specific activities, techniques, and approaches being used.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Goal Alignment" icon="bullseye">
    Shared understanding of the desired outcomes of therapy — what success looks
    like, and whether both parties are working toward the same end.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relational Bond" icon="heart">
    The quality of the human connection — mutual trust, respect, warmth, and the
    client's sense that the therapist genuinely cares about their wellbeing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Alliance in The Empathy Gym™

During training sessions, therapeutic alliance is tracked as a `0.0` to `1.0`
continuous score that evolves throughout the conversation:

- **Below 0.4** — Weak alliance. The system may generate feedback suggesting
  the therapist focus on rapport-building before introducing interventions.
- **0.4 – 0.7** — Developing alliance. The client is cautiously engaged, and
  the system encourages deepening the connection.
- **Above 0.7** — Strong alliance. The therapeutic relationship can support
  more challenging interventions like confrontation, cognitive restructuring,
  or trauma processing.

Alliance strength is influenced by the therapist's demonstrated empathy,
validation, consistency, and respect for the client's autonomy. Alliance
_ruptures_ — moments where the bond weakens — are detected and flagged as
critical learning opportunities.

---

## Conversational dynamics

Beyond the content of what's said, Pixelated Empathy analyzes _how_ the
conversation flows. These dynamics are often invisible to the participants but
are powerful indicators of therapeutic effectiveness.

### Tracked dimensions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tone patterns" icon="waveform-lines">
    Analysis of the emotional color of language over time. The platform tracks
    shifts in tone — from warm to clinical, from tentative to assertive — and
    correlates them with client engagement and alliance strength.

    Tone is measured through linguistic markers (word choice, sentence structure, hedging language) and, when voice mode is active, through acoustic features (pitch variation, speaking rate, volume dynamics).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversational flow" icon="arrows-spin">
    The rhythm of the dialogue — how smoothly turns pass between therapist and
    client. Healthy therapeutic flow involves balanced turn-taking, appropriate
    response latency, and natural topic transitions.

    **Indicators of good flow:**
    - Responses that build on what the client said (vs. abrupt topic changes)
    - Appropriate response length (not too brief, not overwhelming)
    - Questions that feel organic rather than interrogative

    **Red flags:**
    - Multiple rapid-fire questions without processing time
    - Monologue-length responses that dominate the conversation
    - Non-sequitur topic shifts that break the client's narrative

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Emotional reciprocity" icon="arrows-left-right">
    The degree to which the therapist's emotional expression matches (but does
    not mirror) the client's emotional state. Effective reciprocity means
    meeting the client where they are emotionally while maintaining
    professional groundedness.

    - **Under-reciprocity:** Therapist appears flat or disconnected when the client is in distress → damages alliance.
    - **Over-reciprocity:** Therapist becomes as emotionally activated as the client → loses therapeutic presence.
    - **Calibrated reciprocity:** Therapist conveys understanding of the emotional weight while remaining a stable, regulated presence → strengthens alliance.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Silence patterns" icon="volume-xmark">
    Silence in therapy is not empty — it's information. The platform
    distinguishes between:

    - **Productive silence** — The client is processing, integrating, or gathering courage to share something difficult. The therapist holds space without interrupting.
    - **Uncomfortable silence** — An awkward gap where neither party knows how to proceed. Often indicates a missed therapeutic moment.
    - **Resistant silence** — The client is disengaging, shutting down, or expressing passive resistance.

    The appropriate therapeutic response differs for each type. Feedback reports highlight silence patterns and whether the therapist responded effectively.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Crisis signals

Pixelated Empathy's crisis detection system monitors all conversations for
signals that indicate psychiatric or medical emergency. The system operates in
real time across five signal categories.

### Signal categories

| Category            | What it detects                                     | Examples                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-harm**       | Suicidal ideation, self-injury, overdose references | "I don't want to live," "better off dead," "cutting"     |
| **Violence**        | Threats to harm others, weapons references          | "I want to hurt them," "I have a gun"                    |
| **Despair**         | Profound hopelessness, existential crisis           | "No hope," "nothing matters," "can't go on"              |
| **Substance abuse** | Active intoxication, relapse, overdose              | "I'm using again," "I relapsed," "I took too many pills" |
| **Medical**         | Physical health emergencies                         | "Chest pain," "can't breathe," "seizure"                 |

### Risk levels

Each detected signal is assigned a severity score (`0.0`–`1.0`), which maps to
a five-level risk classification:

```text
Risk Level       Severity Score    Response Required
────────────     ──────────────    ──────────────────────────────────────────
Minimal          0.0 – 0.2        No action required
Low              0.2 – 0.4        Monitor; note in session documentation
Moderate         0.4 – 0.7        Flag for supervisor; schedule 24hr follow-up
High             0.7 – 0.9        Notify crisis team; initiate safety plan review
Imminent         0.9 – 1.0        Contact emergency services immediately
```

### Severity modifiers

The base severity score is adjusted upward by contextual factors:

- **Specificity** — Mentions of a specific plan, method, timeline, or means (+0.3)
- **Access to means** — References to having weapons, pills, or other lethal
  means (+0.4)
- **Immediacy** — Language indicating the crisis is happening now ("right now,"
  "tonight") (+0.2)
- **Multiple signals** — More than two concurrent crisis categories elevates the
  risk level

<Warning>
  **In real clinical practice**, crisis assessment requires comprehensive
  clinical judgment beyond pattern matching. The platform's crisis detection is
  designed for *training purposes* — helping therapists practice recognizing and
  responding to crisis signals. It should never be used as the sole basis for
  clinical decision-making with real patients.
</Warning>

### Escalation protocols

Based on risk level, the system generates an appropriate escalation protocol:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Moderate">
    - Flag session for supervisor review - Schedule follow-up within 24 hours -
    Provide crisis resources to the user
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="High">
    - Contact primary therapist for urgent intervention - Notify crisis response
    team - Initiate safety plan review
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Imminent">
    - Contact emergency services (911/112) immediately - Notify on-call
    psychiatrist - Activate immediate location tracking (if applicable)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Bias types

The bias detection system analyzes therapeutic sessions for patterns of
demographic bias that may compromise equitable care. Bias is categorized across
multiple dimensions and scored by severity.

### Bias categories

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Gender bias" icon="venus-mars">
    Stereotypical assumptions based on gender. The system detects patterns
    such as:
    - Attributing emotional expression to gender ("She's being *emotional*" vs.
      "He's being *assertive*")
    - Applying different clinical expectations based on gender
    - Using gendered language patterns (e.g., "hysterical," "overreacting"
      disproportionately applied to women; "stoic," "unemotional" applied to
      men)
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Age bias" icon="calendar">
  Assumptions based on age group: - Dismissing younger clients as "naive" or
  "inexperienced" - Patronizing older clients or assuming cognitive decline -
  Applying generational stereotypes ("entitled millennial," "out-of-touch
  boomer")
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ethnic and racial bias" icon="globe">
  Cultural insensitivity or racial stereotyping: - Backhanded compliments
  ("You're so articulate" applied to non-white clients) - Exoticizing language
  ("foreign," "exotic," "different") - Failing to account for cultural context
  in clinical interpretation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Socioeconomic bias" icon="building">
  Class-based assumptions: - Assuming access to resources (transportation,
  insurance, stable housing) - Recommending interventions that require financial
  privilege - Dismissing environmental stressors as personal failings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="LGBTQ+ bias" icon="rainbow">
  Heteronormative or cisnormative assumptions: - Assuming heterosexual
  relationships - Misgendering or using incorrect pronouns - Pathologizing
  sexual orientation or gender identity
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Religious and spiritual bias" icon="hands-praying">
    Assumptions about faith or spiritual practice:
    - Dismissing spiritual beliefs as clinically irrelevant
    - Imposing the therapist's own spiritual framework
    - Failing to explore how faith functions as a coping resource
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Severity levels

| Level        | Score         | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **None**     | `0.0`         | No bias detected                                             |
| **Low**      | `0.0` – `0.3` | Subtle assumptions or mildly non-inclusive language          |
| **Moderate** | `0.3` – `0.6` | Clear stereotypes or insensitive generalizations             |
| **High**     | `0.6` – `0.8` | Persistent patterns of biased language or clinical reasoning |
| **Critical** | `0.8` – `1.0` | Explicit prejudice or discriminatory content                 |

### Fairness metrics

Beyond individual bias indicators, the platform computes three aggregate
fairness metrics:

- **Demographic parity** (`1.0 - bias_score`) — Are all demographic groups
  receiving equal quality of care?
- **Equalized odds** — Are clinical outcomes being predicted equally across groups?
- **Treatment equality** — Are therapeutic interventions being applied
  equitably regardless of demographics?

<Tip>
  Bias detection is not about punishment — it's about awareness. Even
  experienced therapists carry implicit biases. The platform helps you identify
  patterns you may not be conscious of, so you can deliver more equitable care.
</Tip>

## Putting it all together

These concepts don't operate in isolation. During every training session in The
Empathy Gym™, they work together:

1. The AI client's **Big Five personality** drives their behavioral patterns
   and emotional responses
2. **Plutchik's Wheel** classifies the emotional states that emerge during the conversation
3. **Emotion scoring** quantifies intensity, valence, and arousal in real time
4. The **EARS framework** evaluates the therapeutic quality of your responses
5. **Therapeutic alliance** tracks the evolving strength of the relationship
6. **Conversational dynamics** measure the flow, reciprocity, and rhythm of the
   dialogue
7. **Crisis detection** monitors for safety-critical signals throughout
8. **Bias detection** ensures equitable care across all demographics

Together, these systems provide a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of
