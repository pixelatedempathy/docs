## The Big Picture

Pixelated Empathy isn't a single tool — it's a connected system of
services that work together to create realistic, emotionally intelligent
training experiences for mental health professionals.

Here's the simplified version of how it all fits together:

Let's walk through each piece.

## The Frontend: Where You Train

The interface you interact with is built on **Astro** — a modern web
framework that lets us deliver fast, accessible pages — combined with
**React** for the interactive training components.

When you sit down in The Empathy Gym™, you're looking at:

- A chat-style interface for therapeutic dialogue practice
- Real-time emotional analysis displayed alongside the conversation
- Session feedback and scoring after each practice
- Progress tracking across your training journey

We use **WebSockets** for real-time communication, so the conversation
feels natural — no waiting for page refreshes, no laggy responses.

  Gym™](/platform/empathy-gym) for a full walkthrough of the training
  experience.

## The Brain: Emotional Intelligence Engine

Behind every simulated conversation is our **Emotional Intelligence
Engine** — a Python-based AI system that does several things
simultaneously:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Understands You" icon="ear-listen">
    It analyzes what you say — not just the words, but the tone, the timing, the
    emotional register. Are you reflecting before redirecting? Are you creating
    safety? Are you rushing to fix?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simulates the Client" icon="masks-theater">
    It generates realistic client responses based on emotional profiles — a
    combination of Plutchik's core emotions, Big Five personality traits, and
    scenario-specific context. The responses aren't scripted. They're
    dynamically generated based on the conversational flow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evaluates Your Response" icon="chart-line">
    After each exchange, the engine assesses the quality of your intervention —
    did you validate before advising? Did you use precise emotional language?
    Did you maintain appropriate pacing?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Watches for Crisis Signals" icon="shield-halved">
    Across every conversation, the engine monitors for indicators of severe
    distress or potential harm. This isn't optional functionality — it's woven
    into the core of the system.
  </Card>

## The Memory: Conversation Context

Good therapy isn't just about individual responses — it's about
continuity. A therapist who remembers what a client said three sessions
ago demonstrates a kind of care that single-response AI systems can't
match.

Our **conversation memory system** (powered by Mem0) maintains context
across interactions. It remembers what was discussed, what emotional
patterns emerged, and where the conversation left off. This allows
training scenarios to build over time, just like real therapeutic
relationships.

## The Safety Net: Crisis Detection

We have a separate section dedicated to this because it's that
important.

Crisis detection runs as a parallel process — it's not something that
happens _after_ the conversation. It happens _during_ every single
exchange. If our system detects patterns associated with self-harm,
suicidal ideation, or acute distress, it responds with the seriousness
those signals deserve.

<Warning>
  Crisis detection is never optional. It runs on every exchange, in every
  session, without exception. See [Crisis Detection](/platform/crisis-detection)
  for the full picture.

## The Infrastructure: How It All Runs

    | Validation | Zod                | Runtime data validation |
    | Deployment | Docker Compose     | Service orchestration   |

Everything is containerized with Docker Compose for development,
with Kubernetes support on the roadmap for production scaling.

## The Principle Behind the Architecture

We made a deliberate choice to build a multi-service architecture
rather than a monolith. Here's why:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Separation of Concerns" icon="puzzle-piece">
    The AI engine is complex enough to warrant its own service. The frontend
    needs to be fast. The WebSocket server needs to be always-on. Separating
    these lets each piece do its job well.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety Isolation" icon="shield-halved">
    Crisis detection runs as an always-on monitor. If the main AI engine
    encounters an issue, crisis monitoring continues uninterrupted. Safety
    doesn't depend on everything working perfectly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scalability" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    As our user base grows, different parts of the system will need to scale at
    different rates. Separate services let us scale what needs scaling without
    rebuilding everything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer Experience" icon="code">
    Different parts of the system use different languages (TypeScript for the
    frontend, Python for the AI). Separating them means developers work in the
    environment that's best for the task.
