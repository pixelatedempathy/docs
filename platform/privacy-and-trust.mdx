## Our Promise

We work with some of the most sensitive data in technology:
therapeutic conversations, emotional states, crisis signals, and the
intimate details of how people learn to help others heal.

We don't take that lightly. Here's exactly how we handle it.

## The Short Version

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="No Data Selling" icon="ban">
    Data never sold or shared for ads.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimal Collection" icon="minimize">
    Only what the platform needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encryption" icon="lock">
    Encrypted in transit and at rest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="PII Redaction" icon="eraser">
    PII stripped from training data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Crisis Isolation" icon="shield-halved">
    Crisis data gets highest protection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your Data" icon="download">
    Export or delete at any time.

## What We Collect and Why

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Training Session Data" icon="comments">
    **What**: Your conversations with simulated clients, your
    response patterns, session feedback scores.

    **Why**: This is how the platform works. We need to analyze
    your responses to provide meaningful feedback. We need session
    history to track your progress over time.

    **How long**: Session data is retained as long as your account
    is active. You can delete individual sessions or all data
    at any time.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Emotional Analytics" icon="chart-bar">
    **What**: Aggregated, anonymized patterns from training
    sessions — common mistakes, effective techniques, skill
    progression curves.

    **Why**: To improve The Empathy Gym™. Understanding where
    trainees commonly struggle helps us design better scenarios
    and more targeted feedback.

    **How long**: Analytics data is retained indefinitely but is
    anonymized — it cannot be traced back to individual users.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account Information" icon="user">
    **What**: Email, name, professional role, and authentication
    credentials.

    **Why**: Account management and platform access.

    **How long**: As long as your account exists.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What We Don't Collect

<Warning>
  - Real patient data. Ever. The Empathy Gym™ is a training environment. If
  you're practicing a scenario, the "client" is simulated. - Biometric data. We
  don't track your facial expressions, voice patterns, or physiological
  responses. - Browsing history outside our platform. - Your location, device
  identifiers, or any data beyond what's needed to run the platform.
</Warning>

## Security Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Encryption">
    - **In transit**: All data moves over TLS 1.3
    - **At rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
    - **Secrets management**: API keys, tokens, and credentials
      are managed through environment-level secrets,
      never hardcoded
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Access Control">
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for all internal systems - Principle of
  least privilege — services only access the data they need - Authentication via
  JWT with appropriate expiration policies
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Development Practices">
    Our codebase includes:

    - Automated security scanning in the development pipeline
    - PII detection tools that flag potentially sensitive data
      before it reaches production
    - A "zero-leak policy" — every developer understands that
      leaked credentials or PII is treated as a
      critical incident

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## HIPAA Alignment

While The Empathy Gym™ works with simulated conversations (not real
patient data), we build to **HIPAA-level standards** because:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Professional Context Demands It">
    Our users are mental health professionals. Their professional context
    demands it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upgrading Later Is Risky">
    Building to a lower standard and then trying to upgrade later is expensive
    and risky.
  </Step>
  <Step title="It's the Right Thing to Do">
    It's the right thing to do when you work in the mental health space.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This means:

- Data access is logged and auditable
- We maintain a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) framework
- Incident response procedures are documented and practiced
- Regular security assessments are part of our operations

## AI Training Data

Here's an important question: **Does your data train our AI?**

The honest answer:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Aggregated Patterns — Yes">
    **Anonymized, aggregated patterns** from training sessions may inform
    improvements to our emotional intelligence models. This means we might learn
    from patterns like "trainees consistently miss crisis signals when the
    client uses indirect language" — and use that insight to improve our
    scenario design.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Individual Content — No">
    **Individual session content** is not used to train models without explicit
    consent. Your specific conversations, responses, and feedback remain yours.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  We believe transparency about this is more important than privacy theater.
</Tip>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

To exercise any of these rights, contact our privacy team. We aim to
respond to all requests within 30 days.

## For Developers

If you're contributing to the codebase, privacy is part of your job:

- Run `pnpm security:check` before every commit
- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Use anonymized IDs in all documentation and examples
- If in doubt about whether data constitutes PII, treat it as PII
- Crisis-related data gets the highest protection level in code

<Info>
  For technical guidelines, see the [Developer
  Guidelines](/developers/contributing).

## Questions?

If you have privacy concerns or questions, we want to hear them.
Seriously. A privacy question asked is always better than a privacy
concern left unspoken.
