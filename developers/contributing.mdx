## The Ground Rules

Before writing a line of code, understand what we're building and
why. This isn't a todo app. Every feature, every commit, every design
decision intersects with **psychological safety**. That context
matters.

### What We Expect

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Read AGENTS.md" icon="book">
    It's our technical constitution. Every PR should be consistent with it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Stubs" icon="ban">
    Every implementation must be complete and production-ready. No `TODO`,
    `pass`, `NotImplementedError`, or placeholder returns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Suppression Comments" icon="xmark">
    Don't silence warnings with `eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, or `noqa`. Fix
    the root cause.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validate Emotional Data" icon="check-double">
    If you touch anything related to emotion scores, they must be validated to
    the 0–1 range. Always.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Handle crisis signals.** If your code could encounter crisis indicators, it
  must handle them defensively. This is not optional — it's a core requirement.
</Warning>

### What We Value

- **Clarity over cleverness.** Readable code is
  maintainable code.
- **Type safety.** Use TypeScript strictly. Avoid `any`.
- **Test coverage.** If it can break, it should have a test.
- **Privacy awareness.** Never log, commit, or expose PII.

## Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Environment">
    Follow the [Getting Started](/developers/getting-started) guide.
  </Step>

<Step title="Pick Your Work">
  Check the issue tracker for open items, or propose a new feature. If you're
  new, look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`.
</Step>

  <Step title="Branch">
    Create a feature branch from `main`:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Code">
    Follow our conventions:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="TypeScript">
        - Strict mode, path aliases (`@/`, `@lib/`)
        - Functional components with hooks
        - Formatting: 2 spaces, no semicolons, single
          quotes, trailing commas
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        - Type hints everywhere
        - `uv` for dependencies
        - `pytest` for tests
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Styling">
        - CSS Modules, camelCase class names
        - File naming: PascalCase for components,
          camelCase for utilities
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify">
    Before submitting, run the full quality check:

    ```bash
    # Must all pass
    pnpm check:all        # Lint + typecheck + format
    pnpm test:all         # Full test suite
    pnpm security:scan    # Security audit
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit">
    Write clear, descriptive commit messages. We follow
    conventional commits:

    ```text
    feat(simulator): add emotional timeline visualization
    fix(crisis): improve indirect signal detection accuracy
    docs(knowledge): add cultural empathy article
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit a PR">
    Push your branch and open a pull request. Include:

    - **What** you changed and **why**
    - Any context a reviewer needs
    - Screenshots for UI changes
    - Test results

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Style Quick Reference

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript (Frontend)">
    ```typescript
    // Use path aliases
    import { EmotionAnalyzer }
      from '@/lib/ai/emotion-analyzer'
    import type { EmotionScore } from '@/types'

    // Functional components with explicit props
    interface EmotionCardProps {
      emotion: EmotionScore
      onAnalyze?: (id: string) => void
    }

    export function EmotionCard(
      { emotion, onAnalyze }: EmotionCardProps
    ) {
      // Always validate emotion scores
      const normalizedIntensity =
        Math.max(0, Math.min(1, emotion.intensity))

      return (
        <div className={styles.card}>
          {/* ... */}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python (AI Engine)">
    ```python
    def analyze_emotion(text: str) -> EmotionResult:
        """Analyze emotional content of text.

        Args:
            text: Input text to analyze.

        Returns:
            EmotionResult with scores
            normalized to 0.0–1.0.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If text is empty.
        """
        if not text.strip():
            raise ValueError(
                "Cannot analyze empty text"
            )

        # Complete implementation — never
        # return placeholders
        ...
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security Checklist

Before every PR:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] No PII in code, comments, or test fixtures
- [ ] Emotion scores validated to 0–1 range
- [ ] Crisis detection paths tested
- [ ] `pnpm security:scan` passes
- [ ] `.env.local` is not committed

## Package Managers

<Warning>
  This is non-negotiable:

| Domain      | Use    | Never Use              |
| :---------- | :----- | :--------------------- |
| **Node.js** | `pnpm` | `npm`, `yarn`          |
| **Python**  | `uv`   | `pip`, `conda`, `venv` |

</Warning>

## Questions?

If you're unsure about anything — a design decision, coding
convention, or ethical consideration — ask. We'd rather have a
conversation before the PR than a long review afterward.
