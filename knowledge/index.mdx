## Welcome

You don't need to be a therapist to benefit from understanding how
emotions work. You don't need a psychology degree to have better
conversations. And you definitely don't need to be "naturally empathetic"
to get better at connecting with the people around you.

This is the Pixelated Empathy Knowledge Hub — a collection of
accessible, research-backed articles about human emotion, therapeutic
communication, and the science of connection. We wrote these for
anyone who's curious, whether you're a seasoned clinician or someone
who just wants to understand people a little better.

No jargon walls. No academic gatekeeping. Just honest explorations of
how human beings feel, connect, and heal.

## Our Approach to Knowledge

Everything in this hub is grounded in established psychological
research — primarily Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions and the Big Five
(OCEAN) personality model. We reference peer-reviewed literature,
cite real frameworks, and don't make claims we can't back up.

But we also believe that knowledge shouldn't feel like a lecture. The
best insights about human nature are the ones that make you think,
_"Oh. That explains a lot."_ That's what we're going for.

## A Living Library

<Tip>
  This hub grows. As our research deepens, as our community teaches
  us new things, as the field of emotional intelligence evolves — we'll
  add more. If there's a topic you'd like us to cover, we'd love to
  hear about it.

Because understanding emotion isn't a destination. It's a practice.
