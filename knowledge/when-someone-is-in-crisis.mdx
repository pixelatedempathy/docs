## Why This Article Exists

This isn't clinical training. This is for the college roommate who
notices something wrong. The manager who gets a worrying email. The
friend who sees a social media post that stops them cold. The parent
who walks into a room and _knows_ something has shifted.

You don't need to be a therapist to help someone in crisis. But you
need to know how to do it without making things worse.

## Recognizing a Crisis

A crisis isn't just someone having a bad day. It's a moment when a
person's coping mechanisms are overwhelmed — when the pain exceeds
their capacity to manage it.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verbal Signals" icon="comment-dots">
    - Direct statements: _"I don't want to be here anymore"_ or
      _"Everyone would be better off without me"_

    - Talking about being a burden
    - Saying goodbye in unusual or final-sounding ways
    - Expressing hopelessness about the future

<Accordion title="Behavioral Changes" icon="person-walking">
  - Withdrawal from people, activities, or responsibilities - Giving away

<Info>
  Not every person in crisis will show obvious signs. Some people in deep pain
  are very practiced at hiding it. Trust your instincts. If something feels off,
  it's okay to ask directly.

## What to Do: The Five Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stay Calm">
    Your calm is the most important thing you bring to this moment.
    Not your words. Not your advice. Your presence.

    The person in crisis is experiencing emotional chaos. Your
    steadiness becomes their anchor. If you panic, they lose the one
    stable thing in the room.

    **Breathe.** Slow your voice. Lower your pitch. Sit down if
    possible. Your nervous system can help regulate theirs.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Directly">
    Don't dance around it. If you're worried someone is thinking about
    self-harm, ask them directly:

    > _"Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"_
    > _"Are you thinking about suicide?"_

    This is counterintuitive. Many people fear that asking about
    suicide "plants the idea." **Research consistently shows the
    opposite** — asking directly gives people permission to talk about
    something they're often carrying alone.

    If they say yes, don't panic. Stay calm. You've just opened a
    door that needed opening.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Listen Without Fixing">
    Your job right now is not to solve their problems. It's to make
    them feel heard.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Do Say">
        - _"I'm really glad you told me."_
        - _"That sounds incredibly painful."_
        - _"I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."_
        - _"You don't have to go through this alone."_
        - _"What would feel most helpful right now?"_
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Don't Say">
        - _"But you have so much to live for!"_
        - _"Other people have it worse."_
        - _"Just think positive."_
        - _"I know exactly how you feel."_
        - _"You're not really going to do that."_
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    The "Do" column validates. The "Don't" column dismisses, minimizes,
    or challenges. In a crisis, validation isn't just nice — it's
    safety-critical.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to Help">
    You are not the last line of defense. Your role is to bridge the
    person to professional support.

    If they're resistant to calling a hotline, offer to stay with them
    while they make the call. Or offer to call together. Reducing the
    barrier matters.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow Up">
    After the immediate crisis passes, check in. A text the next day.
    A call that week. The message is: _"I'm still here. That wasn't
    a one-time concern."_

    Many people in crisis feel ashamed afterward. Following up
    communicates that you don't see them differently — that the
    relationship hasn't changed.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Take Care of Yourself

<Warning>
  Being present for someone in crisis is emotionally demanding. You
  need to process that experience too.

- Talk to someone you trust about what happened (while respecting
  the other person's privacy)
- Acknowledge that you did something hard and important
- Know that you don't have to carry this alone either
- Consider speaking with a counselor yourself if the experience
  stays with you
  </Warning>

## How Our Platform Handles This

Our crisis detection system is built on a clear principle: **when in
doubt, escalate.**

The Emotional Intelligence Engine monitors for crisis signals in
real-time during training scenarios. When detected, the system:

1. Flags the signal immediately
2. Provides the trainee with guidance on appropriate response
3. Does not attempt to simulate a crisis resolution (that's for
   trained professionals)
4. Never ignores or minimizes indicators of harm

<Note>
  This is one area where we deliberately err on the side of caution.
  A false positive — flagging something that isn't a crisis — is
  infinitely preferable to a false negative.
