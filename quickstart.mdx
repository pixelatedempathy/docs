## For therapists & counselors

Get from sign-up to your first AI training session in under five minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Navigate to [pixelatedempathy.com](https://pixelatedempathy.com) and click
    **Get Started**. You can sign up with your email or through your
    institution's SSO provider.

    During registration, you'll provide:
    - Your professional role (therapist, counselor, psychologist, social worker,
      student)
    - Years of clinical experience
    - Areas of specialization (optional)
    - Institutional affiliation (if applicable)

    <Tip>
      If your organization has already set up Pixelated Empathy, ask your
      administrator for an **invitation link** — this will automatically
      connect your account to your institution's training program.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete your clinical profile">
    Your clinical profile helps the platform calibrate training scenarios to
    your experience level and learning goals. You'll be asked to:

    1. **Select your training focus areas** — Choose from crisis intervention,
       trauma-informed care, motivational interviewing, couples therapy,
       substance abuse, and more.
    2. **Set your difficulty preference** — Five levels from Beginner (guided
       practice with supportive clients) to Master (complex, multi-issue
       presentations with minimal scaffolding).
    3. **Choose assessment preferences** — Decide whether you want real-time
       feedback during sessions, post-session only, or both.

    <Info>
      You can update your clinical profile at any time from **Settings →
      Clinical Profile**. The platform adapts as your preferences change.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch your first training session">
    From your dashboard, click **Enter The Empathy Gym™** to begin.

    1. **Pick a scenario** — Browse available training scenarios organized by
       category (anxiety, depression, trauma, crisis, personality disorders,
       couples, burnout). Each scenario includes a client briefing with
       background history, presenting concerns, and session context.
    2. **Review the client profile** — Before the session begins, you'll see a
       clinical summary of your AI client including their emotional baseline,
       personality traits, potential triggers, and therapeutic goals.
    3. **Begin the conversation** — Interact with the AI client through text
       or voice. The client responds dynamically based on your therapeutic
       interventions, adapting their resistance level, trust, emotional
       intensity, and openness in real time.

    <Warning>
      **Crisis scenarios** involve sensitive content including suicidal
      ideation and self-harm. These scenarios include built-in safety protocols
      and are clearly labeled. You can skip them or set content preferences in
      your profile.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review your feedback">
    After each session, you'll receive a comprehensive feedback report:

    - **Empathy Score** — How effectively you demonstrated emotional attunement
      and validation (scored 0.0–1.0).
    - **Technique Analysis** — Which therapeutic techniques you applied (CBT,
      DBT, MI, psychodynamic, humanistic) and how effectively.
    - **Bias Check** — Whether any demographic bias patterns were detected in your language or approach.
    - **Crisis Response** (if applicable) — How quickly and appropriately you
      identified and responded to crisis signals.
    - **Therapeutic Alliance** — The strength of the rapport you built,
      measured across task agreement, bond quality, and goal alignment.
    - **Skill Progression** — How this session compares to your historical
      performance across all competency areas.

    <Tip>
      Click any metric in your feedback report to see specific examples from
      the conversation transcript, along with evidence-based suggestions for
      improvement.

## For supervisors & institutions

Set up your organization's training environment and begin monitoring trainee
progress.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register your organization">

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Create trainee cohorts" icon="users">
        Organize trainees into cohorts by class year, specialization, or rotation. Each cohort can have its own:
        - Required scenario sequence
        - Competency benchmarks (minimum scores to advance)
        - Assessment frequency
        - Allowed difficulty levels

        Navigate to **Dashboard → Cohorts → Create New Cohort** and configure your settings.

        Thresholds are configured per cohort under **Dashboard → Cohorts → [Cohort Name] → Competency Settings**.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Invite trainees" icon="envelope">
        Invite trainees via email or generate a bulk invitation link:

        3. Enter email addresses (one per line) or upload a CSV
        4. Select the trainee role and assigned training pathway
        5. Click **Send Invitations**

        Trainees will receive an email with setup instructions and will be automatically enrolled in their assigned cohort upon registration.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor trainee progress">
    The Supervisor Dashboard provides real-time visibility into trainee performance:

    - **Live Observation** — Watch active training sessions in real time with competency tracking overlay.
    - **Intervention Alerts** — Receive notifications when a trainee demonstrates skill deficits requiring immediate attention.
    - **Progress Reports** — View individual and cohort-level analytics including skill progression graphs, common mistake patterns, and breakthrough analysis.
    - **Development Plans** — Generate personalized growth recommendations for each trainee based on their performance data.

    <Info>
      All trainee data is encrypted and access-controlled. Supervisors only see data for trainees in their assigned cohorts. See [Compliance & Security](/compliance/security) for details.

## For developers

Set up the full Pixelated Empathy platform locally for development and contribution.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites:** - Node.js v19 or higher - Python 3.11 or higher - pnpm
  (recommended) or npm - MongoDB (local or Atlas connection string) - Redis
  (local or cloud instance) - Docker (optional, for containerized setup)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pixelatedempathy/pixelated-empathy.git
    cd pixelated-empathy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the frontend and tooling dependencies with pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    Install the Python AI/ML dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ai-services
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ..
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Key variables to configure:

    ```bash
    # Database
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pixelated-empathy
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

    # AI Services
    TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
    FINE_TUNED_THERAPEUTIC_MODEL=meta-llama-3-8b-instruct

    # Authentication
    AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_here

    # Optional: Sentry for error tracking
    SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
    ```

    <Warning>
      Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` is pre-configured to exclude it, but always verify before pushing.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Run the full development stack:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This starts:
    - **Astro dev server** at `http://localhost:4321` — the main application
    - **API routes** served through Astro's Node adapter
    - **Hot module replacement** for instant feedback on code changes

    To run the AI services alongside:

    ```bash
    # In a separate terminal
    cd ai-services
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```

    <Tip>
      Use `pnpm dev --host` to expose the dev server on your local network for testing on other devices.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the test suite">
    Verify everything is working:

    ```bash
    # Unit and integration tests
    pnpm test

    # End-to-end tests
    pnpm test:e2e

    # Python AI service tests
    cd ai-services
    python -m pytest
    ```
